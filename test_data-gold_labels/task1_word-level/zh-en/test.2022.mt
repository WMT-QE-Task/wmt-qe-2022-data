The University's Spirit and the Spirit of the Times - Official website
The so-called university spirit refers to the long-term accumulation of a university in the development process of a series of running ideas and the pursuit of value, is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to the present day, the university spirit has been vital to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first university in the modern sense, the university has assumed a unique mission different from other social organizations. For our university, it arose in the autumn of national danger, its spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changes of the times, advocating the value idea of "Ming Dynasty, Jizei, Shu Qi Jiping" and the patriotism of "Get up to study strong country".
At present, the trend of informationization and internationalization of higher education is becoming increasingly evident, and the global competition in education, science and technology, and talents is intensifying. As an important “supply side,” higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges in its structural reform.
In particular, the proposal of the "Overall Programme for Promoting the Construction of World-Class Universities and First-Class Subjects" demonstrates the confidence and determination of our country to move forward from a high-education country to a high-education country, and at the same time puts forward higher and more up-to-date requirements for the development of universities.
How can we accelerate the construction of a number of world-class universities and a number of world-class subjects in a shorter period of time and achieve the “bend-over”?
In addition to firm objective self-confidence, path self-confidence, and ability self-confidence, universities should also give full play to three advantages: first, a backward advantage, by continuously introducing outstanding academic talents overseas, learning from the advanced experience of world-class universities, and achieving a remarkable improvement in academic standards and the quality of running schools; second, a cultural advantage, inheriting the wisdom connotation of Chinese civilization accumulated over five thousand years, and promoting the development of excellent traditional culture, thereby consolidating strength, shaping brands, and raising the image; and third, a institutional advantage, giving full play to the institutional superiority of the socialist country, strengthening the objective drive, pooling consensus, and optimizing resource allocation, so as to provide sustainable and solid guarantees for schools to accelerate
In particular, we must realize that it is impossible to build a world-class university on a one-sided basis, and each school must show its individuality and characteristics while playing an advantage.
The characteristics of running schools should not only have the Chinese characteristics, but also embody their own unique goals, running traditions and resource endowments.
As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we have focused on highlighting three features in running our school: firstly, we have highlighted the characteristics of innovative entrepreneurial talent cultivation, built an integrated environment for the integration of science, education and enterprises, and formed a whole-chain entrepreneurial education ecosystem; secondly, we have highlighted the characteristics of cross-disciplinary convergence, promoted the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, and built an institutional environment for cross-disciplinary interchange, actively nurtured cross-emerging disciplines and landmark cross-cutting achievements; and thirdly, we have highlighted the characteristics of running our school and social services, conducted deep international exchange and cooperation, and accelerated the formation of a pan-Zhejiang system for cooperation in science and research.
In this process, it is especially important to always stick to the university spirit, so that the university spirit resonates with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the newest system of expression of Zhejiang University’s spirit is founded on the principle of “innovation,” the shared values of “ diligence, virtue, discernment, and faithfulness,” and “the Haina River, enlightenment, virtue, pioneering people, and our nation.”
This is an important guarantee that the school adheres to the correct direction of running the school, continuously accumulates a high level of culture and cohesive spiritual strength, and has rich connotation and far-reaching significance.
Among them, "Hina River" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, embodied in the heart of "the world's talents for me to use" and expressed as the high-quality idea of drawing on the world-famous schools to run and educate people; "Enlightenment and good morality" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and goodness, which means that the university, while pursuing the truth, should be more subject to the cultivation of virtue and personality; "Open-minded people" emphasizes the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes the search for new knowledge, scientific research and innovation, but also expressed as reform development and revolution; "Tree our nation" emphasizes the spirit of patriotic devotion, saying that the university should always be honored and humiliated with the fate of the nation.
This series of spiritual ideas and value pursuit is the soul of Zhejiang University's 120 years of running.
“He who is wise hears in silence, and he who is wise sees in the unseen.”
China's universities and colleges should further build on the overall development of socialism with Chinese characteristics, grasp the historical orientation of higher education and its historical mission, and accelerate the construction of world-class universities.
At the same time, we must uphold humanistic concern and independence, so that the spirit of the university, the spirit of the times and the spirit of the nation can be stirred up, thus providing an inexhaustible impetus for the realization of the nation's wealth and strength, the revival of the nation, and the realization of the common ideal of mankind.

Infectious diseases in Mauritius and other countries were first detected in Omicron.
Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi recently reported the first cases of new crown variant Omicron poisoning, Xinhua reported.
Mauritius reported for the first time two cases of Omicron poisoning in the country on 10 July.
One of the infected was a tourist from South Africa who arrived in Mauritius on 27 November, and the other was a Mauritian resident who tested positive for nucleic acid on 30 November after contacting a person who had recently returned from a trip to South Africa.
After hospital isolation treatment, the two infected patients turned negative for nucleic acid and have now returned to their homes.
The Ministry of Health of Cyprus announced on October 10 that it had confirmed for the first time three cases of Omicron poisoning in the country.
All three were students who had returned from a trip abroad earlier this month. All were mildly ill and had not been admitted to hospital for treatment.
To prevent the spread of the poison, the government of Seychelles has stepped up its efforts to prevent and control it.
From December 6 to January 10, passengers aged 12 and over who check in by air will be required to have their nucleic acid tested at the airport at their own expense.
The health ministry also announced on October 10 that it would start vaccinating children aged 5 to 11 with the new Pfizer vaccine.
Malawi's Minister of Health, Konbise Chibanda, said on Sunday that the country had first detected three cases of the poisonous strain of Omicronium.
The country's health ministry sequenced 12 new crown-positive samples collected from November 9 to December 2, and found three cases of infection.
Students are required to complete a full-time apprenticeship at a state-of-the-art vocational school.
Yesterday, a reporter from the city's Education Commission was informed that starting this year, the city will conduct a pilot "modern apprenticeship" training model in 60 secondary vocational schools.
In accordance with the principle of two-way selection, students, schools and enterprises sign tripartite agreements.For students who have reached the age of 16 but have not reached the age of 18, agreements between students, guardians, schools and enterprises must be signed to determine the rights and interests of all parties and the specific positions, teaching contents and rights and interests guaranteed, etc.
The pilot schools shall be encouraged to use the modern apprenticeship system and jointly with cooperating enterprises to carry out pre-labour and post-labour training for enterprise employees.
The pilot schools should reform the talent training model.
Schools and enterprises shall jointly design personnel training programmes and jointly formulate professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, job standards, enterprise master standards, quality monitoring standards and corresponding implementation programmes.
Students are required to complete a six-month internship at the university, which is usually followed by a six-month internship at the college.
According to the characteristics of different specialties, a master can take 2 to 5 apprentices and form a study group to ensure that students master the skills required for each rotation position.
According to the arrangements, from 2016 to August 2019, the city determined 60 city-level modern apprenticeship pilots in three batches, each numbering about 50 people, for a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices).
In accordance with the principle of first piloting and then implementing, and gradually advancing from point to point, we will explore the establishment of a long-term effective mechanism for joint admission, joint training and integrated human development of schools and enterprises, so as to effectively improve students' job skills and improve the student-to-student employment rate and the quality of employment.
Vietnam People's Daily - The Gulf Cooperation Council Meets Common Challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait.
It is noteworthy that this is the first visit to Qatar by Crown Prince Mohammed since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed a ban on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to the Gulf diplomatic crisis.
In the midst of the crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt severed diplomatic ties with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive embargo, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations while maintaining close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions severely affected Haiti's internal unity and had a negative impact on the economies of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blockaded land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was resolved only at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, when the Gulf states signed an agreement brokered by the United States and Kuwait to move toward “solidarity and stability.”
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are taking the lead in efforts to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors in Qatar.
The Gulf Arab states have resolved their differences and are responding to common challenges by restoring relations with Qatar, a demand that must be united in the interests of all countries and in the interests of regional stability.
During the Saudi Crown Prince's visit to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbours.
A 725-kilometre-long corridor connecting the two countries will facilitate travel and integration of supply chains for citizens of both countries.
Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and the two countries’ companies have signed 13 memorandums of understanding worth $30 billion.
His visit to the Gulf countries coincided with negotiations between Iran and the world over the rescue of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) on Iran’s nuclear program – an agreement that the Gulf Arab states have condemned for failing to resolve the Iranian missile issue.
The Gulf states have always viewed Iran as a long-term “competitor,” and Iran’s nuclear program as a “threat” to regional security.
The Gulf States believe that it is flawed not to resolve the Iranian missile problem and not to take action to curb Iranian activities in the region.
Saudi Arabia has negotiated directly with Iran against the background that the nuclear talks between the major powers and Iran have failed to satisfy the aspirations of the Gulf states.
Its aim is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors slowing down the economic growth of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first summit of the GCC countries since the end of the dispute between some member states and Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess the diplomatic achievements it has made to contribute to the restoration of the unity of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, while proposing measures to enable its member States to cooperate fully to meet common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf States.
The number of university graduates in the Beijing region is expected to reach 26.8 million in 2022.
Xinhua News Agency (Yangna) reported on December 11 that the number of graduates from Beijing's universities is expected to reach 26.8 million in 2022, an increase of 16,000 from last year, according to a videoconference of the 2022 Beijing University Graduates Employment and Entrepreneurship Conference jointly convened by the Beijing Education Commission and the Beijing Human Resources and Social Security Bureau.
The relevant heads of the Beijing Human Resources and Social Security Bureau said they would deploy jobs for graduates of Beijing's universities by strengthening supply-demand matching, strengthening policy support, broadening employment channels, ensuring assistance in difficulties, supporting innovation and entrepreneurship, and improving service efficiency.
The reporters learned that the Beijing Human Resources and Social Security Bureau will set up a practice platform, increase the supply of jobs, actively contact 40 university graduates' workplace experience bases, visit employers, integrate demand information and job information; focus on “six batches,” that is, expand the recruitment batch of institutions, expand the recruitment batch of state-owned enterprises, expand the recruitment batch of grassroots projects, expand the recruitment batch of soldiers, expand the employment apprenticeship retention batch, expand the entrepreneurship-led employment batch; implement dynamic management of the “one-life plan,” recommend not less than five job information for each graduate, ensure that the hard-pressed family graduates who have the will to work achieve help, etc.
Around the sky: Gemini meteor shower on the 14th will be a big one - Xinhua News Agency
As the last large-scale meteor shower of the year, the Gemini meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, will hit the ground running on December 14, and friends who like it will be able to observe it in the middle of the night, Xinhua news agency said on December 12.
A meteor shower in the constellation Gemini was filmed in Qinghai on December 13, 2018 by Beijing astronomer An Jiu.
Most of the meteor shower's parent bodies are periodic comets, but the parent body of the Gemini meteor shower is the Apollo-type asteroid 3200 Phaeton.
The Gemini meteor shower is also the second meteor shower known not to have been "congenital" to a comet.
Shu Lipeng, a director of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an expert on astronomy, said the meteor showers in Gemini usually occur at the end of the year, just like in the Happy New Year movie.
This meteor shower is known for its high flow rate and stability, and together with the quadrant meteor shower and the Perseus meteor shower, it is known as one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere.
A remarkable feature of the Gemini meteor showers is the slow velocity, rich color, and abundance of Martian meteors, suitable for both visual and astronomical photography beginners to shoot.
Tianjin astronomer Yang Jing captured a meteor shower in the constellation Gemini on December 13, 2020 in Tianjin.
Astronomers predict that this year's Gemini meteor shower will reach its peak at around 15:00 on December 14, with a maximum ZHR of 150 (the number of meteors seen per hour when the radiation point is just above the top of the head under ideal observation conditions).
Recommendation Index Chart for Meteor Rain in Gemini.
"Last year, people were impressed by the brilliant Gemini meteor showers, but this year's Gemini meteor showers will be disturbed by the moonlight and their brilliance will be slightly reduced.
The 14th day of the lunar calendar is November 11, and the moon is a full moon, bright moonlight can interfere with the observation, so that the moon will fall late in the night, at which time the radiation point of the meteor shower in Gemini will also rise relatively high.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe them in the hours after midnight, but watch out for cold and warmth.”
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
"It is not advisable to observe in the city, but you can choose a high altitude, low lighting, open view to the northeast, in the suburbs or in the countryside, and then wait patiently for the moon to set for visual observation.
It should be noted that the Gemini meteor shower flows in all directions very large, do not always stare at the radiation point of the Gemini meteor shower when observing.
If you want to shoot a spectacular'meteor shower ', it is best to choose a wide angle, large aperture lens, using high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
Tripods, spare batteries, and shutters are also essential, based on stability and sustainability considerations.”
Shu Lipeng reminded.
3,200 newborn babies in Sabah with no life-saving paper
(API 11) The Sabah National Registry said it had been unable to issue birth certificates to newborn babies since the beginning of October because of the uselessness of specially-made forged paper stockpiles. The number of affected people has thus far reached 3,200.
However, the agency's director, Keru Aminus, has assured that all babies who have applied for birth certificates will be recorded in the system and will be re-issued when the forgery paper arrives next week.
At a news conference, he explained a ten-month-long story by a web-based media outlet about the printing problem in Sabah.
He said the problem arose two months ago and that Sarawak faced the same problem.
“One of the reasons is that Chinese manufacturers of specialty anti-counterfeiting paper have been affected by the epidemic, causing delays in arriving in China.”
He explained that the tamper-resistant paper used in Sabah was different from that used in other areas and could not be lent to stocks held in other states.
The latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on June 6, and was handed over to the printing company for partial printing on August 8, Mr. Keru said.
“The bureau will send people to Kuala Lumpur next Thursday to pick up the goods and return to Sabah immediately for final printing, which is estimated to take two more working days (December 20) to get to the applicants.”
“We will notify applicants to go to the local branch offices to collect the report.”
He added that Sabah had issued 24,81 pieces of paper so far this year.
The amount of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake increased by 0.71 million tons this year.
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, Dec. 11 (reporters Lock Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang) reported from the Agriculture and Rural Department of Qinghai Province that the latest monitoring results showed that the amount of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake increased by 0.71 million tons this year compared to the previous year, reaching 10.85 million tons, more than 40 times the cumulative increase compared to the initial protection in 2002.
The naked carp of Qinghai Lake, popularly known as Huangyu, is a rare species of fish unique to the lake, and plays an important role in maintaining the ecological chain of water-fish-birds and biodiversity in the Qinghai Lake basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake was drastically reduced due to the effects of large-scale human hunting and the declining environment in the naked carp breeding waters.
In 2004, the lake carp was listed as an endangered species in the Chinese Red List of Species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented sealed lake fishing, prohibiting any units, collectives and individuals to fish for carp in the main rivers and tributaries of the Qinghai Lake and Lake District, and prohibiting the sale of carp and its products.
At the same time, the amount of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake has been increasing year by year, through artificial propagation and discharge, as well as by cleaning up the channels through which the lake mainly flows into the lake, designing scientifically reasonable "fish passages," and other measures.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Agriculture and Rural Department of Qinghai Province, said that so far, the Qinghai Lake carp has been artificially propagated and released nearly 180 million tail, contributing more than 23% to the recovery of the Qinghai Lake carp resources.
Qinghai-Sanjiang source area is an important ecological barrier and water reservoir area in China and even in Asia, while Qinghai-Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area that controls the spread of western desertification to the east.
In order to protect the ecological environment in the source area of the Three Rivers and the waters of Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife and preserve the biological diversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has issued notices on the prohibition of fishing in the key waters of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River and the Qinghai Lake since this year, and has established a comprehensive system of "one river, one river, one lake" for the prohibition of fishing.
Students of the University of Zhejiang are the main participants in the academic year.
Wash hands with air, smell diseases, and search for haze sources with accuracy Yesterday evening, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 academic year of Zhejiang University, a series of brain-opening academic achievements were awarded.
The main researchers of these achievements are students.Their research covers various fields such as environment, machinery, energy, medical science, life science, humanities education, etc.The students have created many high-end inventions with application value from a curious point of view, some of which have won national and international awards.
Biosensors: Your Family Physician
Zhang Di-ming, a Ph.D. student at the School of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated a biological sensor at the end of a smartphone that is only half the size of a smartphone.
“All you have to do is take a small breath, and the device will begin to detect your health from the gaseous components that you are exhaling.”
The sensor is connected to a smartphone, and the health report is displayed on the phone when the gas is exhaled, Zhang said.
Smart wristbands that can detect health status are commonly used to detect physical parameters such as temperature, pulse, etc.
The biosensors are made of a new material called graphene, which targets chemical elements and has a keen sense of smell that allows it to reflect health conditions more deeply and accurately.
Smart Surgery Lamp: Doctors' High-Powered Eyes
In addition to smartphones, the operating room also uses smart operating lights.
The invention won a silver medal at the 44th Geneva International Invention Fair this year.
The team of Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, M.Sc. in Optical and Electrical Sciences and Engineering, has opened a new way of thinking in the flaws of traditional surgical lamps, and invented an intelligent LED surgical shadowless lamp.
“Many diseases are detected early and can’t be removed, and they are related to the lights used in doctors’ operating rooms.”
If doctors don't see all the tumor tissue in time for early cancer screening, for example, then the cancer cells will spread,' Shen said.
The smart surgical lamp has four light panels that enhance the differentiation of different tissues under light by adjusting the spectrum.
During surgery, doctors can adjust the size, brightness, spectra, color uniformity, and shadowlessness of spots at any time, depending on the operation needs and personal habits.
The smart surgical light has been tested in Shao Yifu Hospital and Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University Medical School, and received good feedback.
Last October, the invention won first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
Wash your hands with air: water-saving and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, rubbing soap on top, and squeezing hand-washing liquid, while classmates such as Li Kaizhang invented an “air hand-washing device.”
As long as we stand on the device's washstand, our weight can compress the air out.
"It's like an air cylinder.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the tap and combines with the water.
So we can wash our hands!'
Chromatography and bacterial residue experiments have shown that this method has the same effect as conventional hand washing.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the driver, can guarantee the level of cleaning, but also save 90% water, the whole process is completely energy-efficient and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the Second Global Summit on Major Challenges, the invention stood out from many of the world's top universities and won the only gold prize.
"China-Vietnam Joint Defense Exercise "Peace Relief - 2021" Completes" (PDF).
Chinese troops participating in the joint military exercise "Peace Relief - 2021" returned safely to Guangxi on the morning of December 12, Xinhua news agency said, marking the successful completion of the seven-day exercise.
In this joint exercise, the Chinese and Vietnamese armed forces focused on the humanitarian medical rescue as a major issue, tightened the mission of the guards to save the lives and help the wounded, and completed the joint guards command, joint field rescue, batch casualty disposal and other contents in accordance with the standards of actual warfare, and effectively enhanced the security capabilities of the two armies guards.
The results of the exercise were confirmed by the two armies.
"Through the exercise, Vietnamese military doctors have learned from Chinese military doctors about the organization and professional activities of the exercise, as well as about Chinese medical and security equipment," Director of the Vietnamese Exercise Steering Committee, Deputy Director of the General Administration of Logistics and Chief of Staff Nguyen Yuen-sheng said at the closing ceremony.
The results of the exercises proved the professional capabilities of the military and medical forces of the two countries in medical assistance and epidemic prevention and control.
Chen Chunming, the head of China's steering coordination group and deputy director of the Health Bureau of the Ministry of Logistics and Security of the Central Military Commission, said the exercise is another pioneering practice based on the successful joint outpatient clinic activities in 2018 and has a very important milestone significance.
During the exercise, the People's Liberation Army of China donated medical protective masks, medical protective clothing, rapid nucleic acid detection equipment and other health and epidemic prevention supplies to the Vietnamese People's Army.
Education time comment: save abducted children to rely on what?
If we compare the well-known public-interest slogan, "There is no killing without buying and selling," then, in a good environment without the need for "abduction," group-prevention and nationwide counter-abduction would make the act of abduction and selling unprofitable, risky, and costly, and such crimes would not happen again and again.
Recently, the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security kidnapped and developed the missing children information urgently release platform online.
It is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for publishing missing children's information and to find abducted children in a timely manner.
Listening to the app’s name, “Unity,” I felt warm.
New technology means not only the name “art and literature,” full of emotions, but also the application of information technology appropriately, practically, and effectively.
Kidnapping law enforcement, the primary goal is to find the kidnapped children, protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of suspects.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, to social prevention, to legal education, can be summed up in many “big words.”
However, the victim's personal safety should be a priority before a kidnapping case is solved.
It is important to note, however, that in the case of a child who has been abducted and sold for the purpose of rescuing the child, the question of whether or not the child should be executed is a matter of great controversy and can be discussed with caution.
Based on the detection experience of such cases, traffickers are accustomed to moving away from the scene of the crime as soon as possible after the acquisition.
If the kidnapping operation is delayed by more than a minute, the child may be one step further away from the parent, and the difficulty of the case detection will increase by one point.
In this case, it is indeed a pragmatic action to come up with an effective way to help solve the case and find the child directly, such as a platform for “reunification.”
After all, “kidnapping” is a big task that requires the operation of an entire legal system.
The fight against crime, the protection of children's and parents' rights and interests, from the improvement of legislation to the protection of the judiciary, and the rigorous enforcement of laws, do not need to carry out the care of "protecting and supporting the weak".
Moreover, the prevention of child abduction, from the family to society, could be done better.
For example, in a common case, a family of three rests at the railway station, the parents fall asleep and wake up to find the child missing.
One cannot expect a two-year-old child to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, one should at least have a reasonable sense of protection.
Parents taking turns resting or placing their children under proper protection are the least that can be done to prevent their children from being abducted.
From the other side of the police's fight against the crime of kidnapping and selling, the purchase of kidnapped children should also be paid attention to and punished.
A single illegal act is often just a ring in a long chain.
According to the Criminal Law of our country, the statutory penalty for the crime of child abduction and trafficking is five years' imprisonment; the circumstances are particularly serious and can lead to the death penalty and confiscation of property.
The crime of child abduction and trafficking is clearly a more serious crime under the trend of "minimizing the punishment" with a high penalty point and the highest penalty.
However, there are still many cases of trafficking every year.
It can be seen that some people are lagging behind in the concept of child-rearing and legal awareness is weak.
Legal education for this section of the population should be pursued simultaneously.
To effectively control the crime of trafficking, we cannot rely solely on strict official law enforcement.
If the abduction "market" exists widely, the abductors are motivated to innovate the means of abduction, forming a "fighting" situation with law enforcement officials, the abduction action will be ineffective.
Thus, removing backward notions and disseminating common sense of law will also help to eradicate the crime of child abduction and child bribery.
At the end of the democratic summit, Biden says the fire of freedom will never be extinguished
The online Summit for Democracy, convened by US President Barack Obama and attended by governments and civil-society and private-sector leaders from 110 countries around the world, wrapped up on Friday (December 10).
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the fire of freedom burns in the hearts of everyone in the world and that authoritarian regimes can never extinguish it.
He also says he plans to hold the second global “democracy summit” next year.
Taiwanese government representative and councillor Tang Feng and Hong Kong democratic human rights activist Luo Guanzhong, who is currently in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit the following day.
"We know how difficult the work is before us," Biden said.
But we also know that we can meet the challenge, because as I said before, as this summit has shown, the democratic world is everywhere.
Autocratic regimes can never extinguish the flame of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people all over the world, and around the world.”
He added that defending democracy requires a concerted effort on the part of society as a whole.
“As leaders of governments, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to strengthen the shield of democracy, to push for reform, to achieve transparent and accountable governance, to better withstand the forces of despotism’s buffers and shocks, and to those who want to pursue power nakedly before the public interest,” he said.
The second day of the “democracy summit” focused on defending human rights, consolidating democracy and countering authoritarianism, and countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
The day falls on International Human Rights Day.
In his opening remarks, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan said the cause of democracy faces global challenges, particularly those posed by emerging digital technologies.
“The time has come to reaffirm our common values and positions and the resilience of democracy,” he said.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequalities, fighting corruption, renewing social contracts, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
It also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nationalism, and extremism, including the use of all the tools provided by the technological revolution.”
Hong Kong's democratic human rights activist, Mr Lau, addressed the summit in a pre-recorded video, reminding participants of the continuing concerns about the human rights situation in Hong Kong and among minorities such as the Uighurs and Tibetans.
“The world has long accepted China’s rise without a mechanism to hold it accountable,” he said.
That is why politicians and civil-society leaders must work together.
We must use all the resources at our disposal to ensure that the revival of democracy is our first priority.”
He also called on the free world to unite against the threat of the Communist Party of China.
“Perhaps some of you are afraid to annoy the President, perhaps some of you don’t want to lose the Chinese market, perhaps some of you don’t recognize the threat to our democratic values,” he said.
And that's why we failed.
That is why we must change.”
In a roundtable discussion on “Combating Digital Dictatorship and Affirming Democratic Values,” Tang Feng, a member of the Taiwan Executive Yuan, released a video statement emphasizing that Taiwan stands at the forefront of the struggle against authoritarianism and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience of how to combat the new crop epidemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
"At a time when Taiwan's democracy is on the rise, we have always stood firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism and have played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights," he said.
During the epidemic, authoritarian governments everywhere justified human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interests, and global democracy showed signs of retreat.
In Taiwan, however, we don’t have to seal the city to control the epidemic, and we don’t have to go underground to defeat false information.”
On the second day of the summit, the US Treasury announced legal sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities in China, North Korea, and several other countries that have been found to be committing serious human rights violations, as well as investment restrictions on a Chinese company that has been found to be using surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.

After Friday’s “democracy summit,” China’s foreign ministry spokesman said in a speech Saturday (December 11) that the US was holding a “leadership democracy summit,” which would be “an ideological demarcation of democracy as an instrument, as a weapon, as a pseudo-democracy, as an anti-democracy, as an incitement to division and confrontation, and as a transfer of internal contradictions.”
The Chinese government believes that, "For a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on people, carried out 'democratic transformation,' abused unilateral sanctions, and launched a 'color revolution,' with disastrous consequences.
Democracy' has long been America's weapon of mass destruction for interfering in other countries.
The summit was an act of fulfillment by Biden of his campaign promises.
The two-day conference was videotaped and 111 world leaders were invited to attend, including Taiwanese leaders, but neither China nor Russia were invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the US for its own democratic problems, saying the US was not qualified to host such a summit.
There have also been voices of skepticism, both internationally and within the United States, such as criticism of invited leaders, including authoritarian-minded leaders from countries such as the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil, and skepticism that the Biden administration’s real intention was to organize the summit for geopolitical rather than democratic purposes.
Early German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder also attended the video democracy summit
"American democracy is a rich man's game based on capital," China's foreign ministry said in a statement on Saturday.
“As leaders of governments, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to strengthen the shield of democracy, to push for reform, to achieve transparent and accountable governance, to better withstand the forces of despotism and shocks, and to those who want to seek power nakedly before the public interest,” US President Bill Clinton said in a speech.
Democracy, he emphasizes, is not something that can be taken for granted, “we must continually update it among every generation, which, in my view, is the defining challenge of our time.”
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "need fighters to defend democracy in the face of persistent and worrying challenges."
The U.S. side pledged to launch a one-year, $424.4 billion initiative after the summit to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent media.
The US hopes that countries will make concrete, public commitments to improve their democracies before a summit on real democracy is scheduled for late 2022.
"Let us all deliver on our commitments and report on our progress next year," Biden said.

"Twenty-Five Years of U.S. Bloodshed".
(Video Source: Oil Pipe)
On December 11, a micro-documentary titled The Killing Machine was released on the oil pipeline platform.
The film tells the story of the U.S.'s "anti-terrorist" war in Afghanistan, forcing the export of American-style democracy through war, and the 20 years of poor soldiers committing crimes against humanity, such as rape, incest, and the indiscriminate killing of innocent people.
Abuse of UAV air strikes on hospitals, schools and other civilian sites, distortion of humanity, and the establishment of killing teams.
For 20 years, the US has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The U.S. military established a "black prison" to torture and humiliate "suspects" in various ways.
A crime against humanity incites hatred among more Afghans.
As the video puts it, the American “anti-terror” war is “more anti-terrorist than anti-terrorist.”
The war has not brought peace, democracy and prosperity to the Afghan people, but only a devastated country and countless massacres.
Let's uncover the truth about America's bloodthirsty, anti-terrorism policies and the hypocrisy of American democracy!

The digital transformation has become a global problem, and the digital transformation serves the whole population, so it is necessary to mobilize the participation of the whole population.
The people and enterprises are the core, the subject, the goal and the motive force of the digital transformation.
Therefore, all policies must be for the people and enterprises.

48 hours of nucleic acid negative, establish " buffer zone " State Council Joint Defense Joint Control Mechanism requests to strengthen port city epidemic prevention and control - Zhejiang website
The State Council's Joint Defense and Control Mechanism issued a notice on strengthening the control and prevention of pneumonia outbreaks in port cities on December 11, Xinhua news agency reported.It requires persons who recently leave land border port cities (except those connected with ports in Hong Kong and Macao) to have negative certificates for testing nucleic acid within 48 hours, and carry out at least one test of nucleic acid after arriving at the land border port city.
According to the notice, the above-mentioned requirement is for a period of time from the date when the port city scope is determined and announced by the provinces and municipalities to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the Notice also proposes that a port city subject to conditions may study the establishment of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within its jurisdiction.
For some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main economic pillar of the local economy, and people from both sides travel frequently, the head of the Bureau of Disease Prevention and Control of the State Health Commission said.
By implementing a differentiated management policy for the sub-divisions, from one outbreak prevention and control line to two outbreak prevention and control lines, it is hoped that the frontier will be moved forward, the outbreak prevention and control risks will be reduced, and the greatest effect will be achieved with the least social impact and the lowest social cost.
Recently, there have been many cases of indigenous aggregation epidemics in China, all of which are imported from overseas through port cities.
The above-mentioned notice points out that this exposes some local epidemic surveillance early warning in a timely manner, closed-circuit management of high-risk position personnel is not implemented, regular flow of nucleic acid testing in the form, cold chain items in various links can not be eliminated, centralized isolation site management is not standardized, epidemic emergency management is not scientifically accurate, and so on.
In response to the notification request, nine aspects such as improving the mechanism for the prevention and control of epidemics in port cities, improving the early warning system for the monitoring of epidemics, and implementing border control measures have been put into practice.
The notification stressed that port cities should conduct simultaneous research and deployment of epidemic prevention and control and the protection of people's livelihoods, announce and open the hotline for people's livelihoods protection, regularly identify hidden problems in the supply and price of basic necessities of life, and promptly solve and actively respond to the outstanding problems reported by the public.
According to the notification, the port cities referred to therein include the counties (cities, districts, flags) where the open land, water and air ports are located, the cities (territories, states, unions) where the ports are located and the cities directly under the Central Government.
South African Doctor: Omicron is contagious, but mostly mild
Many South African doctors and medical experts believe that the new crown virus Omicron strain causes less disease than the Delta strain, although it spreads at a faster rate.
A group of more than 5,000 doctors in South Africa's Haute-Garonne province reported that they are treating new crown patients with mild symptoms such as body pain and coughing that resemble influenza, the Associated Press reported.
Dr. Unben Pillay, the organization's director, says he sees dozens of patients every day, but no patients need to be hospitalized.
“They were able to control the disease at home,” Pillay said, “and most recovered within 10 to 14 days of isolation.”
He says this includes the elderly and those with health problems who are more likely to become seriously ill from coronary virus infections.
In contrast, he said, in the last wave of the Delta outbreak, he treated patients with new crowns who had "difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels.
Many will be hospitalized in a few days.”
Other doctors shared similar experiences two weeks after the first report of Omicron mutant strains in southern Africa.
Although it will take several weeks to collect enough data, doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the South African National Institute of Infectious Diseases, only 30% of new coronary heart disease patients hospitalized in recent weeks were severe, half the rate of the previous wave; the average length of hospitalization was reduced from 8 to 2.8 days; and only 3% of new coronary heart disease patients died recently, compared to 20% in early-onset outbreaks in South Africa.
“At present, there are almost all indications that it is a mild disease,” said Willem Hanekom, director of the African Health Institute, citing data from the National Institutes of Infectious Diseases and other reports.
"It's still early days and we need to get the later data," he added.
Normally, hospitalizations and deaths occur later, and we only enter this epidemic in two weeks.”
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta is still the world's leading new crown virus strain, Omicron cases are occurring in dozens of countries, with South Africa as the centre of the epidemic.
According to health officials, the number of new cases detected in the first week of December in the province of Hohenzollern increased by 400%, with tests showing more than 90% of cases of Omikyong variants.
Educational Thinking: How the University Examination Makes the " Hegemon " and the " Leftovers " Each Get Its Own - Official Website
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to the head of the university, reflecting the confusion about the university examination, and proposed to improve the difficulty of the examination, changing the examination questions, so that the examination really reflects the students' actual level of aspiration.
Indeed, university exams have long been a “hot topic.”
On the university campus, students come from all over the world, with varying levels of ability, plus varying degrees of learning and studying conditions.
It is inevitable that there will be different feelings when evaluating groups with such diverse characteristics.
Of course, if the test questions are of a single type, repetition rates are high, the subject is too simple, it will inevitably cause a completely different feeling.
Students who do not study hard may be able to pass the exam by concentrating on assault. If you think of other ways, it is possible to achieve half the effect.
In this way, “study residue” can pass and even score high if it is not invested in; “study bully” never drops out of class, has good homework and notes, and does not score high on exams.
In this way, the students of Lanzhou University reflect the problems that exist in the university examination is not without reason, believe that the situation does not exist only Lanzhou University.
In this sense, praise the three students who wrote the letter.
In fact, everyone who has attended university knows that it is not uncommon for students to rush to prepare for exams, think of various ways to "take up" exam questions from their teachers, try to delineate the scope of the examination, and seek "focused guidance" before the examination. It is also not uncommon for students to take notes in the examination and ask their teachers to raise their hand after the examination.
In the author's view, as a kind of teaching quality assessment guideline, the measurement of a university examination's qualification or not lies more in the teacher's comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, and the scientific proposition on this basis.
In the undergraduate stage of university, the majors begin to be subdivided, and many of the major courses are based on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that mastering the basic knowledge of a subject is the content of the university examination.
The undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory and common sense of the subject, the space of change from the point of knowledge is not large, it is basically fixed.
As one teacher put it, “The basics of university mathematics, 20 years ago, are still being studied, or the focus.”
However, the knowledge point is basically unchanged, does not mean that the test question type is single, the test question repeated.
In many universities, examinations are usually composed of a group of questions, then by senior subject teachers to co-ordinate the examination papers, examination papers also by all teachers of the subject participate, so as to overcome to some extent the repetition of the examination questions.
However, to prepare a set of test questions in accordance with teaching and learning practice, the subjects are difficult to present a normal distribution according to the student's overall learning situation, it is also necessary to master the teaching situation comprehensively, comprehensively analyze the degree of student's learning, so as to make the test proposition to the difficulty and the type of the dynamic grasp, can highlight the basic knowledge examination, but also take into account the ability examination, and at the same time carry out the innovative design of the type of the question.
The examination is the commanding rod of university education, what kind of examination, students will have the corresponding preparation program, will affect the university education's effectiveness in the long run.
To the students' letter of recommendation, Lanzhou Jiao University attaches great importance, has deployed the correction program in the whole school.
Teaching units shall be required to organize teachers to carry out research and self-examination of course-ending examinations against each other, to formulate examination questionnaire propositions and related systems, and at the same time to strengthen the supervision and examination of examination questionnaire propositions and examination links, to fine-tune the assessment of achievements, and to strengthen the comprehensive examination of all links of course teaching.
It is important to note that in order for a teacher to have a complete grasp of the teaching situation, he must not only digest the teaching content, but also digest the student's learning situation, and digest both the teaching and learning situation, so that the teaching and learning will interact better and form a positive interaction, and the examination will be more in line with the actual situation, so that the hegemon and the scum will get their way.

Iranian President: If sanctions against Iran are lifted Iranian nuclear negotiations are expected to reach an agreement
Tehran, Dec. 11 (Xinhua) – Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said on December 11 in Tehran that a “good deal” could be reached by negotiating a comprehensive agreement on Iran’s nuclear issue if the United States lifts sanctions on Iran.
In a meeting with Iranian envoys in the region on the same day, Lehi said Iran had proved its negotiating spirit by submitting proposals to other parties to the Iranian nuclear deal, according to the Iranian president's website.
If the US is determined, “the road to agreement will be clear.”
The parties to the Iran nuclear deal began talks in April in Vienna, the Austrian capital, to discuss the resumption of U.S.-Iran talks.
A new round of talks began in Vienna on 29 November, was suspended on 3 December, and resumed on 9 December.
Asian-American Association for the Prevention of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
More than 130 Asian-American groups filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Justice on May 23 to protest the discriminatory admissions practices of three prestigious universities in the United States: Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College.
The Asian Education League, which brought the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
The group's chairman, Zhao Yuqing, said at the conference that the number of Asian applicants who met the admission criteria for top US universities had doubled in the past decade, but the proportion of Asians in the top three US universities remained essentially the same.
Many studies have shown that these institutions “continuously and systematically discriminate against Asian applicants” in their so-called “comprehensive consideration” admissions process.
A 2014 study by scholars such as Sanders showed Asians had the lowest admission rates among all ethnic groups in the three universities, Zhao said.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also show that among all the Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest enrollment rates for Asian students, and Yale and Brown have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao told Xinhua that they hoped that after submitting the complaint, the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Justice would investigate and, after establishing the facts, take measures to stop these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in admissions.
They also hoped that the complained universities would take the matter seriously and change their admission policies for Asians.
At present, the three universities complained have not responded.
The Association for Asian Education, founded in 2015, filed a complaint against Harvard University's enrollment discrimination, but the U.S. Department of Education denied the complaint on procedural grounds.
In addition to the Chinese-American groups involved in the complaint, there are also Indian-American, Korean-American, Japanese-American, and Pakistani-American educational groups.

A girl stands in front of a large wooden board in Hangzhou's Wulin Square with the words "human flesh target, ten yuan one arrow" written on it.
Yesterday morning, a photo of "Hangzhou girl Gan Dan 'arrow target' for her sister's donation" blew up the circle of friends.
The photo shows a girl standing in front of a wooden board slightly taller than a person in Hangzhou's Wulin Square, with the words "human flesh target, ten yuan one arrow" written on the board, indicating that pedestrians can use bow and arrow fire after paying.
The incident sparked controversy amongst online users.
Last night, the head of publicity for the downtown branch of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau confirmed to reporters in Xinjing that the police confirmed that the girl raised money for her sister to make such an outrageous move, but the behavior is not worth promoting, the girl has left the local police station yesterday after being warned.
Girls on the Streets "Arrow Target" Donation Admonition
In the video, a long-haired girl stands in front of a large wooden board with the words "human flesh target, ten yuan one arrow" written on it in black ink, and she has her bank account and WeChat account, pay treasure account, etc. on the other board.
The picture sparked controversy after it was posted on the Internet.
Some netizens viewed the move as “an eye-opening act of begging,” and many expressed sympathy.
“We found out when we patrolled the square around 10 a.m. on the 23rd, when there were already a lot of people around.”
In an interview with the local media, police officers at the Tianshui police station near the scene said that there were two girls in the stalls, all around 20 years old, dressed in youthful beauty.
Among them, the girl who was the "target of human flesh" was crying, asking passers-by to play the game; the other girl at the side shouted, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia, now urgently needed surgery, please help everyone.
“We contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was collecting donations for her sister’s leukemia treatment.”
Last night, the head of publicity of the downtown branch of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau told reporters in Xinjing News that the girl's name is Ji Jiali, for her sister Ji Jia Yan.
But with treatment still costing more than $300,000, it took a while to think of a good way to raise money.
He said that during the whole process, the two girls, one as a target, one responsible for launching, but did not participate in the whole process, no one found an arrow, only someone surrounded and took a photo posted on the microblogging.
After the police were appraised by the security department, the use of bows and arrows was not controlled.
The person in charge stated that "there is no advocacy for this kind of open-minded fund-raising".
After being warned by the police, she left the police station.
Don't frighten people on the starting line - Official website
When you go to the bookstore, you can often feel the burst of success books.
Many of today’s successful textbooks preach “best principles” – that is, assuming or implying that you can “do it,” and then telling you “what it is” that you need to do.
It's like saying that we've gone beyond the "how to" part, which is really the most important and fundamental part.
That’s why these books have one thing in common – either do your best at it, or do nothing at all; either 100, or 0; or you climb Mount Tai, or you stay where you are.
This “best principle” is recognized as “excellently correct” by anyone who sees it, but 99% of people are frightened to the finish line.
Because this theory advocates a path of “making up your mind, reinventing yourself, making a big 180-degree shift,” which is precisely what many people’s fatal weaknesses are.
To a man who follows the rules, follows the old, and refuses to change, you must yell in his ear, “You must change.”
The vast majority of people are shy and unable to make up their minds when faced with the word change; or they may have made up their minds to change on the impulse of a moment, and have taken the first step bravely, but often in a short space of time, and then lose the battle in a short space of time.
The echo of Mr. Ma's famous "From Tomorrow onwards" is the most iconic expression of this "universal humanity" classic.
The biggest problem with the “best principles” is that the threshold is too high, often exceeding the limits of ordinary people’s abilities, for the vast majority of people to “wail at the door.”
Perhaps the “second-best principle” is the way to get more ordinary people onto the path to relative success.
At the heart of the “second-best principle” is “reducing the threshold” – which encourages a “win-win-win” theory, that is, if you can’t do 100, you can only do one: because one is always greater than zero; and if you can’t climb Mount Tai, you can only climb the little dunes at your doorstep, because that’s always better than walking.
Anyway, as long as you do something, it's always better than not doing it.
Because the threshold has been greatly reduced, there is much more chance that ordinary people will stick to it, and the probability of success will increase as long as everything sticks to it.
The road to success is just a little longer, following the “second-best principle.”
In short, the “best principle,” while ostensibly a banner of success for all, ultimately inspires few, if any, people; and the “second-best principle,” in effect, inspires more people and benefits them as much as possible.
"Support for the 2019 Gulf Science Forum".
China's President Xi Jinping sent a letter of congratulations to the Bay Area Science Forum in 2021.
Xi pointed out that today’s world is undergoing unprecedented changes. Global technological innovation has entered an intensive period of activity, and a new round of technological revolution and industrial change has profoundly affected the global economic structure.
Guangdong, Hong Kong, Macao and the Gulf region should focus on the strategic positioning of the construction of the international center of scientific and technological innovation, strive to build a global high ground of scientific and technological innovation, and promote the development of new industries.
Together with scientists from all over the world and international scientific and technological organizations, China is willing to closely exchange and cooperate in international science and technology, strengthen research on major scientific problems, promote the breakthrough of common science and technology, deepen cooperation on key scientific projects, and jointly promote the development of world scientific undertakings and better serve humanity.
The 2021 Dawan Science Forum will be held in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, on the theme of “Exploring the Future, Sharing Science.”
The maximum length of time a student can stay in the university is five years.
Xinhua News Agency (Xinhua News Agency) has learned from the Education Department of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region on May 19 that universities in Guangxi will implement a flexible education system in the future, relaxing the period for university students to leave school, the period for students to leave school to start a business can be extended from two to five years on the basis of the original education system, and the period for students to leave school to start a business can be regarded as the time for practical education.
In order to promote the ability of university students to entrepreneurship and innovation, Guangxi education, human society and other departments have jointly set up entrepreneurship platforms, built more university students' out-of-school practice teaching bases, university science and technology parks, university students' entrepreneurship parks, entrepreneurship incubation bases, and so on, to provide university students with external guarantees for entrepreneurship.
According to the requirement, by 2020, each university's innovation and entrepreneurship practice base area, undergraduate schools should reach more than 3000 square meters, vocational schools should reach more than 2000 square meters.
The government encourages universities to set up innovation and entrepreneurship credits, and gives priority to supporting students who excel in innovation and entrepreneurship practices to transfer to professional fields.
In order to improve the consciousness and ability of teachers to innovate and start-up education, teachers in universities and colleges should take at least two months every two years to engage in vocational training in industry enterprises.
The Office of Education of the Autonomous Region demands Guangxi universities to implement the university students' innovation and entrepreneurship training program in depth, striving to make every university student participate in an innovation and entrepreneurship training program while in school.
Universities should actively organize students to participate in innovation and entrepreneurship competitions at all levels and provide financial support.

The Yorubas constitute around 45 million people in Africa , are a few hundred thousand outside the continent , and bear further representation among members of the African diaspora .
The vast majority of the Yoruba population is today within the country of Nigeria , where they make up 15.5 % of the country's population according to CIA estimations , making them one of the largest ethnic groups in Africa .
Most Yoruba people speak the Yoruba language , which is the Niger - Congo language with the largest number of native or L1 speakers .
In Africa , the Yoruba are contiguous with the Yoruboid Itsekiri to the south - east in the northwest Niger delta , Bariba to the northwest in Benin and Nigeria , the Nupe to the north and the Ebira to the northeast in central Nigeria .
To the east are the Edo , Ẹsan and the Afemai groups in mid - western Nigeria .
To the northeast and adjacent to the Ebira and northern Edo groups are the related Igala people on the left bank of the Niger River .
Significant Yoruba populations in other West African countries can also be found in Ghana , Benin , Ivory Coast , and Sierra Leone .
This early 1600 ' s reference implies that the name Yoruba was already in demotic use since at least the 1500s .
Regarding the source and derivation of this name , guesses were posited by various foreign sociologists of external sources .
As of the 7th century BCE the African peoples who lived in Yorubaland were not initially known as the Yoruba , although they shared a common ethnicity and language group .
The historical Yoruba develop in ṣitu , out of earlier Mesolithic Volta - Niger populations , by the 1st millennium BCE .
Oral history recorded under the Oyo Empire derives the Yoruba as an ethnic group from the population of the older kingdom of Ile - Ife .
The Yoruba were the dominant cultural force in southern and Northern , Eastern Nigeria as far back as the 11th century .
The Yoruba are among the most urbanized people in Africa .
In ancient times , most of these cities were fortresses , with high walls and gates .
Yoruba cities have always been among the most populous in Africa .
Archaeological findings indicate that Òyó - Ilé or Katunga , capital of the Yoruba empire of Oyo ( fl . between the 11th and 19th centuries CE ) , had a population of over 100,000 people .
For a long time also , Ibadan , one of the major Yoruba cities and founded in the 1800s , was the largest city in the whole of Sub Saharan Africa .
Today , Lagos ( Yoruba : Èkó ) , another major Yoruba city , with a population of over twenty million , remains the largest on the African continent .
Archaeologically , the settlement of Ile - Ife showed features of urbanism in the 12th – 14th century era .
The dynasty of kings at Ile - Ife , which is regarded by the Yoruba as the place of origin of human civilization , remains intact to this day .
The urban phase of Ile - Ife before the rise of Oyo , c . 1100 – 1600 , a significant peak of political centralization in the 12th century , is commonly described as a " golden age " of Ile - Ife .
The oba or ruler of Ile - Ife is referred to as the Ooni of Ife .
Ife continues to be seen as the " Spiritual Homeland " of the Yoruba .
The city was surpassed by the Oyo Empire as the dominant Yoruba military and political power in the 11th century .
The Oyo Empire under its oba , known as the Alaafin of Oyo , was active in the African slave trade during the 18th century .
The Yoruba often demanded slaves as a form of tribute of subject populations , who in turn sometimes made war on other peoples to capture the required slaves .
Part of the slaves sold by the Oyo Empire entered the Atlantic slave trade .
In more recent decades , Lagos has risen to be the most prominent city of the Yoruba people and Yoruba cultural and economic influence .
Noteworthy among the developments of Lagos were uniquely styled architecture introduced by returning Yoruba communities from Brazil and Cuba known as Amaros / Agudas .
Yoruba settlements are often described as primarily one or more of the main social groupings called " generations " .
The " first generation " includes towns and cities known as original capitals of founding Yoruba kingdoms or states .
The " second generation " consists of settlements created by conquest .
The " third generation " consists of villages and municipalities that emerged following the internecine wars of the 19th century .
The Yoruba culture was originally an oral tradition , and the majority of Yoruba people are native speakers of the Yoruba language .
The number of speakers is roughly estimated at about 30 million in 2010 .
Yoruba is classified within the Edekiri languages , and together with the isolate Igala , form the Yoruboid group of languages within what we now have as West Africa .
Igala and Yoruba have important historical and cultural relationships .
The languages of the two ethnic groups bear such a close resemblance that researchers such as Forde ( 1951 ) and Westermann and Bryan ( 1952 ) regarded Igala as a dialect of Yoruba .
The area where North - West Yoruba ( NWY ) is spoken corresponds to the historical Oyo Empire .
Literary Yoruba is the standard variety taught in schools and spoken by newsreaders on the radio .
Yoruba people form their sense of group identity around a number of cultural references and practices recognizable by members of the group both within and outside their region of influence .
Monarchies were a common form of government in Yorubaland , but they were not the only approach to government and social organization .
The numerous Ijebu kingdom city - states to the west of Oyo and the Egba people communities , found in the forests below Ọyọ's savanna region , were notable exceptions .
These independent polities often elected a king though real political , legislative , and judicial powers resided with the Ogboni , a council of notable elders .
The notion of the divine king was so important to the Yoruba , however , that it has been part of their organization in its various forms from their antiquity to the contemporary era .
During the internecine wars of the 19th century , the Ijebu forced citizens of more than 150 Ẹgba and Owu communities to migrate to the fortified city of Abeokuta .
Each quarter retained its own Ogboni council of civilian leaders , along with an Olorogun , or council of military leaders , and in some cases , its own elected Obas or Baales .
These independent councils elected their most capable members to join a federal civilian and military council that represented the city as a whole .
He described Abẹokuta and its system of government as " the most extraordinary republic in the world . "
Gerontocratic leadership councils that guarded against the monopolization of power by a monarch were a trait of the Ẹgba , according to the eminent Ọyọ historian Reverend Samuel Johnson .
Such councils were also well - developed among the northern Okun groups , the eastern Ekiti , and other groups falling under the Yoruba ethnic umbrella .
Traditionally kingship and chieftainship were not determined by simple primogeniture , as in most monarchic systems of government .
The Ọbas live in palaces that are usually in the center of the town .
Opposite the king's palace is the Ọja Ọba , or the king's market .
These markets form an inherent part of Yoruba life .
Traditionally their traders are well organized , have various guilds , officers , and an elected speaker .
They also often have at least one Iyaloja , or Lady of the Market , who is expected to represent their interests in the aristocratic council of oloyes at the palace .
The monarchy of any city - state was usually limited to a number of royal lineages .
A family could be excluded from kingship and chieftaincy if any family member , servant , or slave belonging to the family committed a crime , such as theft , fraud , murder or rape .
In other city - states , the monarchy was open to the election of any free - born male citizen .
In Ilesa , Ondo , Akure and other Yoruba communities , there were several , but comparatively rare , traditions of female Ọbas .
The kings were traditionally almost always polygamous and often married royal family members from other domains , thereby creating useful alliances with other rulers .
The city became a military republic , with distinguished soldiers wielding political power through their election by popular acclaim and the respect of their peers .
Similar practices were adopted by the Ijẹsa and other groups , which saw a corresponding rise in the social influence of military adventurers and successful entrepreneurs .
The Ìgbómìnà were renowned for their agricultural and hunting prowess , as well as their woodcarving , leather art , and the famous Elewe masquerade .
There are also examples of other peer organizations in the region .
When the Ẹgba resisted the imperial domination of the Ọyọ Empire , a figure named Lisabi is credited with either creating or reviving a covert traditional organization named Ẹgbẹ Aro .
In the city - states and many of their neighbours , a reserved way of life remains , with the school of thought of their people serving as a major influence in West Africa and elsewhere .
Today , most contemporary Yoruba are Muslims or Christians .
The Yoruba religion comprises the traditional religious and spiritual concepts and practices of the Yoruba people .
Its homeland is in Southwestern Nigeria and the adjoining parts of Benin and Togo , a region that has come to be known as Yorubaland .
Yoruba religion is formed of diverse traditions and has no single founder .
Yoruba religious beliefs are part of itan , the total complex of songs , histories , stories and other cultural concepts that make up the Yoruba society .
One of the most common Yoruba traditional religious concepts has been the concept of Orisa .
Orisa ( also spelled Orisha ) are various godly forms that reflect one of the various manifestations or avatars of God in the Yoruba religious system .
He understands every language spoken by humankind , and is also the guardian of the crossroads , Oríta méta in Yoruba ) and Orunmila ( a god of the Oracle ) .
The two other principal forms of the supreme God are Olodumare — the supreme creator — and Olofin , who is the conduit between Òrunn ( Heaven ) and Ayé ( Earth ) .
These varieties , or spiritual lineages as they are called , are practiced throughout areas of Nigeria , among others .
As interest in African indigenous religions grows , Orisa communities and lineages can be found in parts of Europe and Asia as well .
While estimates may vary , some scholars believe that there could be more than 100 million adherents of this spiritual tradition worldwide .
Oral history of the Oyo - Yoruba recounts Odùduwà to be the progenitor of the Yoruba and the reigning ancestor of their crowned kings .
After the death of Oduduwa , there was a dispersal of his children from Ife to found other kingdoms .
Each child made his or her mark in the subsequent urbanization and consolidation of the Yoruba confederacy of kingdoms , with each kingdom tracing its origin due to them to Ile - Ife .
After the dispersal , the aborigines became difficult , and constituted a serious threat to the survival of Ife .
Thought to be survivors of the old occupants of the land before the arrival of Oduduwa , these people now turned themselves into marauders .
They would come to town in costumes made of raffia with terrible and fearsome appearances , and burn down houses and loot the markets .
Then came Moremi on the scene ; she was said to have played a significant role in the quelling of the marauders advancements .
But this was at a great price ; having to give up her only son Oluorogbo .
The reward for her patriotism and selflessness was not to be reaped in one lifetime as she later passed on and was thereafter deified .
The Edi festival celebrates this feat amongst her Yoruba descendants .
Yoruba culture consists of cultural philosophy , religion and folktales .
They are embodied in Ifa divination , and are known as the tripartite Book of enlightenment in Yorubaland and in its diaspora .
Yoruba cultural thought is a witness of two epochs .
The first epoch is a history of cosmogony and cosmology .
He pondered the visible and invisible worlds , reminiscing about cosmogony , cosmology , and the mythological creatures in the visible and invisible worlds .
His time favored the artist - philosophers who produced magnificent naturalistic artworks of civilization during the pre - dynastic period in Yorubaland .
The second epoch is the epoch of metaphysical discourse , and the birth of modern artist - philosophy .
This commenced in the 19th century in terms of the academic prowess of Bishop Samuel Ajayi Crowther ( 1807 – 1891 ) .
Thus , it is believed that thought ( philosophy ) is an antecedent to religion .
Values such as respect , peaceful co - existence , loyalty and freedom of speech are both upheld and highly valued in Yoruba culture .
Societies that are considered secret societies often strictly guard and encourage the observance of moral values .
Today , the academic and nonacademic communities are becoming more interested in Yoruba culture .
More research is being carried out on Yoruba cultural thought as more books are being written on the subject .
The Yoruba are traditionally very religious people , and are today pluralistic in their religious convictions .
The Yoruba are one of the more religiously diverse ethnic groups in Africa .
Many Yoruba people are Muslims practicing mostly under Sunni Islam of the Maliki school of law while others are Christians under various denominations .
In addition to Islam and Christianity , a large number of Yoruba people continue to practice their traditional religion .
Yoruba religious practices such as the Eyo and Osun - Osogbo festivals are witnessing a resurgence in popularity in contemporary Yorubaland .
They are largely seen by the adherents of the modern faiths as cultural , rather than religious , events .
They participate in them as a means to celebrate their people's history , and boost tourism in their local economies .
The Yorubas were one of the first groups in West Africa to be introduced to Christianity on a large scale .
Christianity ( along with western civilization ) came into Yorubaland in the mid - 19th century through the Europeans , whose original mission was commerce .
The first European visitors were the Portuguese , they visited the neighboring Bini kingdom in the late 16th century .
As time progressed , other Europeans - such as the French , the British , the Dutch , and the Germans , followed suit .
Home governments encouraged religious organizations to come .
The increased tempo of Christianity led to the appointment of Saros and indigenes as missionaries .
This move was initiated by Venn , the CMS Secretary .
Due to this , Islam is traditionally known to the Yoruba as Esin Male or simply Imale i.e . religion of the Malians .
Islam was practiced in Yorubaland so early on in history , that a sizable proportion of Yoruba slaves taken to the Americas were already Muslim .
The Mosque served the spiritual needs of Muslims living in Ọyọ .
Progressively , Islam started to gain a foothold in Yorubaland , and Muslims started building mosques .
All of these cities already had sizable Muslim communities before the 19th century Sokoto jihad .
Medieval Yoruba settlements were surrounded with massive mud walls .
Yoruba buildings had similar plans to the Ashanti shrines , but with verandahs around the court .
It was made up of sprawling mud walls and the valleys that surrounded the town of Ijebu - Ode in Ogun State .
Sungbo's Eredo is the largest pre - colonial monument in Africa , larger than the Great Pyramid or Great Zimbabwe .
The Yorubas worked with a wide array of materials in their art including ; bronze , leather , terracotta , ivory , textiles , copper , stone , carved wood , brass , ceramics and glass .
A unique feature of Yoruba art is its striking realism that , unlike most African art , chose to create human sculptures in vividly realistic and life sized forms .
The art history of the nearby Benin empire shows that there was a cross – fertilization of ideas between the neighboring Yoruba and Edo .
The Benin court's brass casters learned their art from an Ife master named Iguegha , who had been sent from Ife around 1400 at the request of Benin's oba Oguola .
Indeed , the earliest dated cast - brass memorial heads from Benin replicate the refined naturalism of the earlier Yoruba sculptures from Ife .
A lot of Yoruba artwork , including staffs , court dress , and beadwork for crowns , are associated with palaces and the royal courts .
The courts also commissioned numerous architectural objects such as veranda posts , gates , and doors that are embellished with carvings .
Yoruba palaces are usually built with thicker walls , are dedicated to the gods and play significant spiritual roles .
Yoruba art is also manifested in shrines and masking traditions .
The shrines dedicated to the said gods are adorned with carvings and house an array of altar figures and other ritual paraphernalia .
Masking traditions vary by region , and diverse mask types are used in various festivals and celebrations .
Aspects of Yoruba traditional architecture has also found its way into the New World in the form of shotgun houses .
Today , however , Yoruba traditional architecture has been greatly influenced by modern trends .
Masquerades are an important feature of Yoruba traditional artistry .
They are generally known as Egúngún , singularly as Egún .
The term refers to the Yoruba masquerades connected with ancestor reverence , or to the ancestors themselves as a collective force .
There are different types of which one of the most prominent is the Gelede .
An Ese Ifa ( oral literature of Orunmila divination ) explains the origins of Gelede as beginning with Yemoja , the Mother of all the orisa and all living things . .
Her first child was a boy , nicknamed " Efe " ( the humorist / joker ) ; the Efe mask emphasizes song and jests because of the personality of its namesake .
Yemoja's second child was a girl , nicknamed " Gelede " because she was obese like her mother .
After getting married themselves , neither Gelede or Efe's partner could have children .
The Ifa oracle suggested they try the same ritual that had worked for their mother .
No sooner than Efe and Gelede performed these rituals – dancing with wooden images on their heads and metal anklets on their feet – they started having children .
These rituals developed into the Gelede masked dance and were perpetuated by the descendants of Efe and Gelede .
This narrative is one of many stories that explains the origin of Gelede .
An old theory stated that the beginning of Gelede might be associated with the change from a matriarchal to a patriarchal society among the Yoruba people .
These occasions are avenues to experience the richness of the Yoruba culture .
The Yoruba are a very expressive people who celebrate major events with colorful festivals and celebrations ( Ayeye ) .
Some of these festivals ( about thirteen principal ones ) are secular and only mark achievements and milestones in the achievement of mankind .
The festival is dedicated to the river goddess Osun , which is usually celebrated in the month of August ( Osù Ògùn ) yearly .
The festival attracts thousands of Osun worshippers from all over Yorubaland and the Yoruba diaspora in the Americas , spectators and tourists from all walks of life .
The lighting of this sacred lamp heralds the beginning of the Osun festival .
Then comes the ' Ibroriade ' , an assemblage of the crowns of the past ruler , the Ataoja of Osogbo , for blessings .
Another very popular festival with spiritual connotations is the Eyo Olokun festival or Adamu Orisha play , celebrated by the people of Lagos .
The Eyo festival is a dedication to the god of the Sea Olokun , who is an Orisha , and whose name literally mean Owner of the Seas .
Generally , there is no customarily defined time for the staging of the Eyo Festival .
This leads to a building anticipation as to what date would be decided upon .
Once a date for its performance is selected and announced , the festival preparations begin .
The procession moves through Lagos Island Isale Eko , which is the historical centre of the Lagos metropolis .
On the streets , they move through various crucial locations and landmarks in the city , including the palace of the traditional ruler of Lagos , the Oba , known as the Iga Idunganran .
The festival starts from dusk to dawn , and has been held on Saturdays ( Ojó Àbáméta ) from time immemorial .
A full week before the festival ( always a Sunday ) , the ' senior ' Eyo group , the Adimu ( identified by a black , broad - rimmed hat ) , goes public with a staff .
When this happens , it means the event will take place on the following Saturday .
The Eyo masquerade essentially admits tall people , which is why it is described as Agogoro Eyo ( literally meaning the tall Eyo masquerade ) .
This response connotes the masquerades as rejoicing with the person greeting it for the witnessing of the day , and its own joy at taking the hallowed responsibility of cleansing .
The music of the Yoruba people is perhaps best known for an extremely advanced drumming tradition , especially using the dundun hourglass tension drums .
The representation of musical instruments on sculptural works from Ile - Ife , indicates , in general terms a substantial accord with oral traditions .
A lot of these musical instruments date back to the classical period of Ile - Ife , which began at around the 10th century A.D .
Others like the double and single iron clapper - less bells are examples of instruments that preceded classical Ife .
Yoruba folk music became perhaps the most prominent kind of West African music in Afro - Latin and Caribbean musical styles .
Yoruba music left an especially important influence on the music of Trinidad , the Lukumi religious traditions , Capoeira practice in Brazil and the music of Cuba .
Yoruba drums typically belong to four major families , which are used depending on the context or genre where they are played .
The Dùndún / Gángan family , is the class of hourglass shaped talking drums , which imitate the sound of Yoruba speech .
Typically , they played a ceremonial role in royal settings , weddings and Oríkì recitation ; it is predominantly found in traditions such as Sakara music , Were and Fuji music .
The Gbedu family ( literally , " large drum " ) is used by secret fraternities such as the Ogboni and royal courts .
Historically , only the Oba might dance to the music of the drum .
If anyone else used the drum they were arrested for sedition of royal authority .
The Gbèdu are conga shaped drums played while they sit on the ground .
It is also shaped like a conga but with a wider array of sounds and a bigger body .
Today , the word Gbedu has also come to be used to describe forms of Nigerian Afrobeat and Hip Hop music .
The fourth major family of Yoruba drums is the Bàtá family , which are well - decorated double - faced drums , with various tones .
They are believed to have been introduced by Shango , an Orisha , during his earthly incarnation as a warrior king .
He is also believed to be the spirit or muse that inspires drummers during renditions .
This is why some Yoruba family names contain the prefix ' Ayan - ' such as Ayangbade , Ayantunde , Ayanwande .
Ensembles using the dundun play a type of music that is also called dundun .
The leader of a dundun ensemble is the oniyalu meaning ; ' Owner of the mother drum ' , who uses the drum to " talk " by imitating the tonality of Yoruba .
Much of this music is spiritual in nature , and is often devoted to the Orisas .
Yoruba music is typically Polyrhythmic , which can be described as interlocking sets of rhythms that fit together somewhat like the pieces in a jigsaw puzzle .
There is a basic timeline and each instrument plays a pattern in relation to that timeline .
The resulting ensemble provides the typical sound of West African Yoruba drumming .
Yoruba music is a component of the modern Nigerian popular music scene .
Twins are very important for the Yoruba and they usually tend to give special names to each twin .
Twins are perceived as having spiritual advantages or as possessing magical powers .
This is different from some other cultures , which interpret twins as dangerous or unwanted .
Traditionally , the Yoruba count their week starting from the Ojó Ògún , this day is dedicated to Ògún .
Solid food , mostly cooked , pounded or prepared with hot water are basic staple foods of the Yoruba .
These foods are all by - products of crops like cassava , yams , cocoyam and forms a huge chunk of it all . Others like Plantain , corn , beans , meat , and fish are also chief choices .
Soups include egusi , ewedu , okra , vegetables are also very common as part of diet .
Items like rice and beans ( locally called ewa ) are part of the regular diet .
Some dishes are also prepared for festivities and ceremonies such as jollof rice and fried rice .
The Yoruba take immense pride in their attire , for which they are well known .
Clothing materials traditionally come from processed cotton by traditional weavers .
They also believe that the type of clothes worn by a man depicts his personality and social status , and that different occasions require different clothing outfits .
Clothing in Yoruba culture is gender sensitive , despite a tradition of non - gender conforming families .
Some fashionable men may add an accessory to the Agbádá outfit in the form of a wraparound ( Ìbora ) .
They also have various types of Sòkòtò or native trousers that are sewn alongside the above - mentioned dresses .
Women also have matching Gèlè ( head gear ) that must be put on whenever the Ìró and Bùbá is on .
Just as the cap ( Fìlà ) is important to men , women's dressing is considered incomplete without Gèlè .
Apart from this , they also have ìborùn ( Shawl ) and Ìpèlé ( which are long pieces of fabric that usually hang on the left shoulder and stretch from the hind of the body to the fore ) .
At times , it is tied round their waists over the original one piece wrapper .
Tòbi is like the modern day apron with strings and spaces in which women can keep their valuables .
They tie the tòbi around the waists before putting on the Ìró ( wrapper ) .
Sinmí is like a sleeveless T - shirt that is worn under before wearing any other dress on the upper body .
There are many types of beads ( Ìlèkè ) , hand laces , necklaces ( Egba orùn ) , anklets ( Egba esè ) and bangles ( Egba owó ) that are used in Yorubaland .
These are used by both males and females , and are put on for bodily adornment .
Chiefs , priests , kings or people of royal descent , especially use some of these beads as a signifier of rank .
An accessory especially popular among royalty and titled Babalawos / Babalorishas is the Ìrùkèrè , which is an artistically processed animal tail , a type of Fly - whisk .
The horsetail whiskers are symbols of authority and stateliness .
It can be used in a shrine for decoration but most often is used by chief priests and priestesses as a symbol of their authority or Ashe .
As most men go about with their hair lowly cut or neatly shaven , the reverse is the case for women .
There are many types of plaiting styles , and women readily pick any type they want .
This is apart from the fact that they show clearly from which part of Yorubaland an individual comes from , since different areas are associated with different marks .
Different types of tribal marks are made with local blades or knives on the cheeks .
The Yoruba believe that development of a nation is akin to the development of a man or woman .
Therefore , the personality of an individual has to be developed in order to fulfil his or her responsibilities .
Clothing among the Yoruba people is a crucial factor upon which the personality of an individual is anchored .
This belief is anchored in Yoruba proverbs . Different occasions also require different outfits among the Yoruba .
There exists an old and thriving Yoruba community in Ghana tracing back to more than three centuries of establishment .
The presence of Yoruba people in Ghana traces back to before the concept of the modern Ghanaian nation and are therefore Ghanaian citizens by law .
The Yoruba communities became established through various waves and layers for centuries before the colonial era .
Rather , they would barter for the release of the Yoruba captives who would in turn work for their benefactors as tradesmen until they earned their release .
Then came the third wave who came during the Gold Coast colonial period .
They were the largest group of immigrants established in pre - independence Ghana .
It was the early stream of this wave in the 1830s that established places like Accra New Town which was previously known as Lagos town and before then as Araromi .
In the 1960 Ghanaian population census , there were 109,090 Yorubas . Of this figure ; 100,560 were Yoruba ' proper ' while 8,530 were Atakpame ( Ana ) .
There are both immigrant Yoruba communities from Nigeria , and indigenous ancestral Yoruba communities living in Togo .
Otherwise known as " Anago traders " , they dominate certain sectors of the retail economy and number at least 135,000 people .
The migration of Yoruba people all over the world has led to a spread of the Yoruba culture across the globe .
Yoruba people have historically been spread around the globe by the combined forces of the Atlantic slave trade and voluntary self migration .
Yorubas are overrepresented in the genetic studies of African Americans and are not the largest contributors of African American DNA by any means .
According to a 19th - century report , " the Yoruba are , still today , the most numerous and influential in this state of Bahia .
The most numerous are those from Oyo , capital of the Yoruba kingdom .
In the documents dating from 1816 to 1850 , Yorubas constituted 69.1 % of all slaves whose ethnic origins were known , constituting 82.3 % of all slaves from the Bight of Benin .
Between 1831 and 1852 the African - born slave and free population of Salvador , Bahia surpassed that of free Brazil born Creoles .
Meanwhile , between 1808 and 1842 an average of 31.3 % of African - born freed persons had been Nagos ( Yoruba ) .
Genetic studies have shown the Yoruba to cluster most closely with other West African peoples .

The Yoruba communities became established through various waves and layers for centuries before the colonial era .
Rather , they would barter for the release of the Yoruba captives who would in turn work for their benefactors as tradesmen until they earned their release .
This earliest wave was followed by an intermediate wave of slave returnees who were predominantly of Yoruba descent like the Taboms / Agudas who settled along the Ghanaian coast .
Then came the third wave who came during the Gold Coast colonial period .
By this period , they had firmly entrenched themselves in the country's commerce and distribution systems and constituted a substantial percentage of merchants and traders in the country's large markets as proprietors of wholesale enterprises .
They were the largest group of immigrants established in pre - independence Ghana .
It was the early stream of this wave in the 1830s that established places like Accra New Town which was previously known as Lagos town and before then as Araromi .
There is no codification for the Yoruba ethnicity in the most recent Ghanaian censuses but in previous ones , they were considered an indigenous Ghanaian group with origins outside modern Ghana .
In the 1960 Ghanaian population census , there were 109,090 Yorubas . Of this figure ; 100,560 were Yoruba ' proper ' while 8,530 were Atakpame ( Ana ) .

However , the country ranks very low in the Human Development Index and remains one of the most corrupt nations in the world .
It is also a member of the informal MINT group of countries and is one of the Next Eleven economies .
The name Nigeria was taken from the Niger River running through the country .
This name was coined on January 8 , 1897 , by British journalist Flora Shaw , who later married Lord Lugard , a British colonial administrator .
The neighbouring Niger takes its name from the same river .
The origin of the name Niger , which originally applied to only the middle reaches of the Niger River , is uncertain .
The transition from Neolithic times to the Iron Age was achieved without intermediate bronze production .
The Nok civilization of Nigeria flourished between 1,500 BC and AD 200 .
The Kingdom of Nri of the Igbo people consolidated in the 10th century and continued until it lost its sovereignty to the British in 1911 .
Nri was ruled by the Eze Nri , and the city of Nri is considered to be the foundation of Igbo culture .
Nri and Aguleri , where the Igbo creation myth originates , are in the territory of the Umeuri clan .
Members of the clan trace their lineages back to the patriarchal king - figure Eri .
In West Africa , the oldest bronzes made using the lost wax process were from Igbo - Ukwu , a city under Nri influence .
The Yoruba kingdoms of Ife and Oyo in southwestern Nigeria became prominent in the 12th and 14th centuries , respectively .
The oldest signs of human settlement at Ife's current site date back to the 9th century , and its material culture includes terracotta and bronze figures .
Europeans traded goods with peoples at the coast ; coastal trade with Europeans also marked the beginnings of the Atlantic slave trade .
Other major slaving ports in Nigeria were located in Badagry , Lagos on the Bight of Benin and Bonny Island on the Bight of Biafra .
The majority of those enslaved and taken to these ports were captured in raids and wars .
Usually , the captives were taken back to the conquerors ' territory as forced labour ; after time , they were sometimes acculturated and absorbed into the conquerors ' society .
Slave routes were established throughout Nigeria linking the hinterland areas with the major coastal ports .
Oyo , at its territorial zenith in the late 17th to early 18th centuries , extended its influence from western Nigeria to modern - day Togo .
In the north , the incessant fighting amongst the Hausa city - states and the decline of the Bornu Empire gave rise to the Fulani people gaining headway into the region .
At the beginning of the 19th century , Usman dan Fodio led a successful jihad against the Hausa Kingdoms founding the centralised Sokoto Caliphate .
The empire with Arabic as its official language grew rapidly under his rule and that of his descendants , who sent out invading armies in every direction .
The territory controlled by the empire included much of modern - day northern and central Nigeria .
By the 1890s , the largest slave population in the world , about two million , was concentrated in the territories of the Sokoto Caliphate .
The use of slave labour was extensive , especially in agriculture .
By the time of its break - up in 1903 into various European colonies , the Sokoto Caliphate was one of the largest pre - colonial African states .
The Atlantic slave trade was engaged in by European companies until it was outlawed in 1807 .
After that illegal smugglers purchased slaves along the coast by native slavers .
Britain's West Africa Squadron sought to intercept the smugglers at sea .
In 1864 , Samuel Ajayi Crowther became the first African bishop of the Anglican Church .
In 1885 , British claims to a West African sphere of influence received recognition from other European nations at the Berlin Conference .
The following year , it chartered the Royal Niger Company under the leadership of Sir George Taubman Goldie .
The defeat of these states opened up the Niger area to British rule .
By 1902 , the British had begun plans to move north into the Sokoto Caliphate .
British General Lord Frederick Lugard was tasked by the Colonial Office to implement the agenda .
As the British approached the city of Sokoto , Sultan Muhammadu Attahiru I organized a quick defence of the city and fought the advancing British - led forces .
The British force quickly won , sending Attahiru I and thousands of followers on a Mahdist hijra .
In the northeast , the decline of the Bornu Empire gave rise to the British - controlled Borno Emirate which established Abubakar Garbai of Borno as ruler .
In 1903 , the British victory in the Battle of Kano gave them a logistical edge in pacifying the heartland of the Sokoto Caliphate and parts of the former Bornu Empire .
On 13 March 1903 , at the grand market square of Sokoto , the last vizier of the caliphate officially conceded to British rule .
The British appointed Muhammadu Attahiru II as the new caliph .
Lugard abolished the caliphate but retained the title sultan as a symbolic position in the newly organized Northern Nigeria Protectorate .
This remnant became known as " Sokoto Sultanate Council " .
In June 1903 , the British defeated the remaining forces of Attahiru I and killed him ; by 1906 resistance to British rule had ended .
On 1 January 1914 , the British formally united the Southern Nigeria Protectorate and the Northern Nigeria Protectorate into the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria .
Administratively , Nigeria remained divided into the Northern and Southern Protectorates and Lagos Colony .
Inhabitants of the southern region sustained more interaction , economic and cultural , with the British and other Europeans owing to the coastal economy .
By the middle of the 20th century , a great wave for independence was sweeping across Africa .
Christian missions established Western educational institutions in the protectorates .
Under Britain's policy of indirect rule and validation of Islamic tradition , the Crown did not encourage the operation of Christian missions in the northern , Islamic part of the country .
Some children of the southern elite went to Great Britain to pursue higher education .
By independence in 1960 , regional differences in modern educational access were marked .
The legacy , though less pronounced , continues to the present day .
Imbalances between north and south were expressed in Nigeria's political life as well .
For instance , northern Nigeria did not outlaw slavery until 1936 whilst in other parts of Nigeria slavery was abolished soon after colonialism .
The opposition comprised the comparatively liberal Action Group , which was largely dominated by the Yoruba and led by Obafemi Awolowo .
An imbalance was created in the polity as the result of the 1961 plebiscite .
The northern part of the country became larger than the southern part .
In 1963 , the nation established a federal republic , with Azikiwe as its first president .
The disequilibrium and perceived corruption of the electoral and political process led to two military coups in 1966 .
The first coup was in January 1966 and was led mostly by Igbo soldiers under Majors Emmanuel Ifeajuna and Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu .
Senate President Nwafor Orizu handed over government control to the Army , under the command of another Igbo officer , General Johnson Aguiyi - Ironsi .
Later , the counter - coup of 1966 , supported primarily by Northern military officers , facilitated the rise of Yakubu Gowon as military head of state .
Tension rose between north and south ; Igbos in northern cities suffered persecution and many fled to the Eastern Region .
This declaration precipitated the Nigerian Civil War , which began as the official Nigerian government side attacked Biafra on 6 July 1967 , at Garkem .
The 30 - month war , with a long siege of Biafra and its isolation from trade and supplies , ended in January 1970 .
Estimates of the number of dead in the former Eastern Region during the 30 - month civil war range from one to three million .
France , Egypt , the Soviet Union , Britain , Israel , and others were deeply involved in the civil war behind the scenes .
Following the war , Nigeria enjoyed an oil boom in the 1970s , during which the country joined OPEC and received huge oil revenues .
Despite these revenues , the military government did little to improve the standard of living of the population , help small and medium businesses , or invest in infrastructure .
As oil revenues fueled the rise of federal subsidies to states , the federal government became the centre of political struggle and the threshold of power in the country .
The coup in July 1975 , led by Generals Shehu Musa Yar'Adua and Joseph Garba , ousted Gowon , who fled to Britain .
Colonel Buka Suka Dimka launched a February 1976 coup attempt , during which General Murtala Muhammed was assassinated .
Dimka lacked widespread support among the military , and his coup failed , forcing him to flee .
After the coup attempt , General Olusegun Obasanjo was appointed military head of state .
As head of state , Obasanjo vowed to continue Murtala's policies .
In 1977 , a constituent assembly was elected to draft a new constitution , which was published on September 21 , 1978 , when the ban on political activity was lifted .
The military carefully planned the return to civilian rule putting in place measures to ensure that political parties had broader support than witnessed during the first republic .
In 1979 , five political parties competed in a series of elections in which Alhaji Shehu Shagari of the National Party of Nigeria ( NPN ) was elected president .
All five parties won representation in the National Assembly .
On October 1 , 1979 , Shehu Shagari was sworn in as the first President and Commander - in - Chief of the Federal Republic of Nigeria .
Obasanjo peacefully transferred power to Shagari , becoming the first head of state in Nigerian history to willingly step down .
The Shagari government became viewed as corrupt by virtually all sectors of Nigerian society .
In 1983 , the inspectors of the state - owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation began to notice " the slow poisoning of the waters of this country " .
In August 1983 Shagari and the NPN were returned to power in a landslide victory , with a majority of seats in the National Assembly and control of 12 state governments .
But the elections were marred by violence , and allegations of widespread vote - rigging and electoral malfeasance led to legal battles over the results .
There were also uncertainties , such as in the first republic , that political leaders may be unable to govern properly .
The 1983 military coup d'état took place on New Year's Eve of that year .
The military coup of Muhammadu Buhari shortly after the regime's re - election in 1984 was generally viewed as a positive development .
Buhari promised major reforms , but his government fared little better than its predecessor .
In 1986 , he established the Nigerian Political Bureau which made recommendations for the transition to the Third Nigerian Republic .
He urged all Nigerians to join either of the parties , which Chief Bola Ige referred to as " two leper hands . "
The two - party state had been a Political Bureau recommendation .
The 1993 presidential election held on 12 June , was the first since the military coup of 1983 .
However , Babangida annulled the elections , leading to massive civilian protests that effectively shut down the country for weeks .
Babangida's regime has been considered the most corrupt and responsible for creating a culture of corruption in Nigeria .
In 1995 , the government hanged environmentalist Ken Saro - Wiwa on trumped - up charges in the deaths of four Ogoni elders .
Several hundred million dollars in accounts traced to Abacha were discovered in 1999 .
His successor , General Abdulsalami Abubakar , adopted a new constitution on May 5 , 1999 , which provided for multiparty elections .
Ethnic violence for control over the oil - producing Niger Delta region and an insurgency in the northeast are some of the issues facing the country .
Umaru Yar'Adua of the People's Democratic Party came into power in the general election of 2007 . ’
The international community , which had been observing Nigerian elections to encourage a free and fair process , condemned this one as being severely flawed .
President Olusegun Obasanjo acknowledged fraud and other electoral " lapses " but said the result reflected opinion polls .
Goodluck Jonathan was sworn in as Yar'Adua's successor , [ 84 ] becoming the 14th head of state .
Jonathan was generally praised for conceding defeat and limiting the risk of unrest .
In the 2019 presidential election , Buhari was re - elected for a second term in office defeating his closet rival Atiku Abubakar .
Nigeria is a federal republic modelled after the United States , [ 93 ] with executive power exercised by the President .
The president is both head of state and head of the federal government ; the president is elected by popular vote to a maximum of two four - year terms .
The president's power is checked by a Senate and a House of Representatives , which are combined in a bicameral body called the National Assembly .
The Senate is a 109 - seat body with three members from each state and one from the capital region of Abuja ; members are elected by popular vote to four - year terms .
The House contains 360 seats , with the number of seats per state determined by population .
All major parties have practised vote - rigging and other means of coercion to remain competitive .
In 2012 , Nigeria was estimated to have lost over $ 400 billion to corruption since independence .
Kin - selective altruism is prevalent in Nigerian politics , resulting in tribalist efforts to concentrate Federal power to a particular region of their interests .
The two major political parties are the People's Democratic Party of Nigeria and the All Progressives Congress , with twenty registered minor opposition parties .
The country has a judicial branch , with the highest court being the Supreme Court of Nigeria .
The laws of Nigeria are written down , meaning that Nigeria practices written constitution .
The current written constitution of Nigeria is the 1999 constitution as amended .
This is in support of the doctrine sometimes called Pax Nigeriana .
The Nigerian Military consists of an army , a navy , and an air force .
The military in Nigeria has played a major role in the country's history since independence .
Various juntas have seized control of the country and ruled it through most of its history .
Its last period of military rule ended in 1999 following the sudden death of Sani Abacha in 1998 .
His successor , Abdulsalam Abubakar , handed over power to the democratically elected government of Olusegun Obasanjo the next year .
As Africa's most populated country , Nigeria has repositioned its military as a peacekeeping force on the continent . Under an African Union mandate , it has stationed forces in Sudan's Darfur region to try to establish peace .
One exception to the African focus was Nigeria's close relationship developed with Israel throughout the 1960s .
Israel sponsored and oversaw the construction of Nigeria's parliament buildings .
Nigeria's foreign policy was put to the test in the 1970s after the country emerged united from its civil war .
It supported movements against white minority governments in the Southern Africa sub - region .
Nigeria backed the African National Congress by taking a committed tough line about the South African government and their military actions in southern Africa .
Nigeria was a founding member of the Organisation for African Unity ( now the African Union ) and has tremendous influence in West Africa and Africa on the whole .
Nigeria is also a member of the International Criminal Court and the Commonwealth of Nations .
It was temporarily expelled from the latter in 1995 when ruled by the Abacha regime .
Nigeria has remained a key player in the international oil industry since the 1970s and maintains membership in OPEC , which it joined in July 1971 .
Since 2000 , Chinese – Nigerian trade relations have risen exponentially .
However , the structure of the Chinese – Nigerian trade relationship has become a major political issue for the Nigerian state .
This is illustrated by the fact that Chinese exports account for around 80 per cent of total bilateral trade volumes .
This has resulted in a serious trade imbalance , with Nigeria importing ten times more than it exports to China .
Subsequently , Nigeria's economy is becoming over - reliant on cheap imports to sustain itself , resulting in a clear decline in Nigerian industry under such arrangements .
Nigeria is divided into thirty - six states and one Federal Capital Territory , which are further sub - divided into 774 local government areas .
Lagos is the largest city in Africa , with a population of over 12 million in its urban area .
The main rivers are the Niger and the Benue , which converge and empty into the Niger Delta .
This is one of the world's largest river deltas and the location of a large area of Central African mangroves .
Nigeria's most expansive topographical region is that of the valleys of the Niger and Benue river valleys ( which merge and form a Y - shape ) .
To the southeast of the Benue are hills and mountains , which form the Mambilla Plateau , the highest plateau in Nigeria .
This plateau extends through the border with Cameroon , where the montane land is part of the Bamenda Highlands of Cameroon .
The areas surrounding Calabar , Cross River State , also in this forest , are believed to contain the world's largest diversity of butterflies .
Everything in between the far south and the far north is savannah ( insignificant tree cover , with grasses and flowers located between trees ) .
Guinean forest - savanna mosaic is plains of tall grass interrupted by trees .
Sudan savannah is similar but with shorter grasses and shorter trees .
Sahel savannah consists of patches of grass and sand , found in the northeast .
In the Sahel region , rain is less than 500 millimetres ( 20 in ) per year , and the Sahara Desert is encroaching .
In the dry northeast corner of the country lies Lake Chad , which Nigeria shares with Niger , Chad and Cameroon .
Nigeria has numerous tree species , of which the majority of them are native while few are exotic .
A high percentage of man - made forests in the country is dominated by exotic species .
This culminated from the assumption that exotic trees are fast - growing .
However , studies have also investigated the growth of indigenous trees in with that of exotic species .
However , very little is known about IAS in Nigeria , with most technical reports and literature reporting fewer than 10 invasive plants in the country .
Aside from plant invaders , Rattus rattus and Avian influenza virus were also considered IAS in Nigeria .
The initial entry of IAS into Nigeria was mainly through exotic plant introductions by the colonial rulers either for forest tree plantations or for ornamental purposes .
Many other species native to Nigeria , including soybean and its varieties , serve as an important source of oil and protein in this region .
There are also many plants with medicinal purposes that are used to aid the therapy in many organs .
Some of the solutions have been disastrous to the environment , resulting in untreated waste being dumped in places where it can pollute waterways and groundwater .
In 2005 , Nigeria had the highest rate of deforestation in the world , according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations .
That year , 12.2 % , the equivalent of 11,089,000 hectares had been forested in the country .
Between 1990 and 2000 , Nigeria lost an average of 409,700 hectares of forest every year equal to an average annual deforestation rate of 2.4 % .
Between 1990 and 2005 , in total Nigeria lost 35.7 % of its forest cover or around 6,145,000 hectares .
Nigeria had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 6.2 / 10 , ranking it 82nd globally out of 172 countries .
In the year 2010 , thousands of people were inadvertently exposed to lead - containing soil from informal gold mining within the northern state of Zamfara .
Economic development has been hindered by years of military rule , corruption , and mismanagement .
The restoration of democracy and subsequent economic reforms have successfully put Nigeria back on track towards achieving its full economic potential .
Next to petroleum , the second - largest source of foreign exchange earnings for Nigeria are remittances sent home by Nigerians living abroad .
During the oil boom of the 1970s , Nigeria accumulated a significant foreign debt to finance major infrastructural investments .
Arrears and penalty interest accumulated on the unpaid principal , which increased the size of the debt .
Nigeria made history in April 2006 by becoming the first African country to completely pay off its debt ( estimated $ 30 billion ) owed to the Paris Club .
As of 2010 , about 30 % of Nigerians are employed in agriculture .
Agriculture used to be the principal foreign exchange earner of Nigeria .
Rubber is the second - largest non - oil foreign exchange earner .
Before the Nigerian civil war , Nigeria was self - sufficient in food .
Agriculture has failed to keep pace with Nigeria's rapid population growth , and Nigeria now relies upon food imports to sustain itself .
The Nigerian government promoted the use of inorganic fertilizers in the 1970s .
In August 2019 , Nigeria closed its border with Benin and other neighbouring countries to stop rice smuggling into the country as part of efforts to boost local production .
Nigeria is the 12th largest producer of petroleum in the world , the 8th largest exporter , and has the 10th largest proven reserves .
Petroleum plays a large role in the Nigerian economy , accounting for 40 % of GDP and 80 % of government earnings .
In June 2013 , Shell announced a strategic review of its operations in Nigeria , hinting that assets could be divested .
While many international oil companies have operated there for decades , by 2014 most were making moves to divest their interests , citing a range of issues including oil theft .
In August 2014 , Shell said it was finalising its interests in four Nigerian oil fields .
Nigeria has a total of 159 oil fields and 1,481 wells in operation according to the Department of Petroleum Resources .
The most productive region of the nation is the coastal Niger Delta Basin in the Niger Delta or " south - south " region which encompasses 78 of the 159 oil fields .
Most of Nigeria's oil fields are small and scattered , and as of 1990 , these small fields accounted for 62.1 % of all Nigerian production .
This contrasts with the sixteen largest fields which produced 37.9 % of Nigeria's petroleum at that time .
Despite huge deposits of these natural resources , the mining industry in Nigeria is still in its infancy .
Nigeria's ICT sector has experienced a lot of growth , representing 10 % of the nation's GDP in 2018 as compared to just 1 % in 2001 .
Lagos is regarded as one of the largest technology hubs in Africa with its thriving tech ecosystem .
Several startups like Paystack , Interswitch , Bolt and Piggyvest are leveraging technology to solve issues across different sectors .
The largest , Millennium Park , was designed by architect Manfredi Nicoletti and officially opened in December 2003 .
Currently , Lagos is primarily known as a business - oriented and fast - paced community .
Lagos has become an important location for African and black cultural identity .
Many festivals are held in Lagos ; festivals vary in offerings each year and may be held in different months .
Established in 2010 , the event takes place over a 3 to 5 days period at selected high - quality outdoor venues .
The music is as varied as the audience itself and features a diverse mix of musical genres from rhythm and blues to soul , Afrobeat , hip hop , bebop , and traditional jazz .
The festivals provide entertainment of dance and song to add excitement to travellers during a stay in Lagos .
Nigeria has a manufacturing industry that includes leather and textiles ( centred in Kano , Abeokuta , Onitsha , and Lagos ) .
Nigeria currently has an indigenous auto manufacturing company , Innoson Vehicle Manufacturing located in Nnewi .
In this regard , some foreign vehicle manufacturing companies like Nissan have made known their plans to have manufacturing plants in Nigeria .
Ogun is considered to be Nigeria's current industrial hub , as most factories are located in Ogun and more companies are moving there , followed by Lagos .
Nigeria has a few electronic manufacturers like Zinox , the first branded Nigerian computer , and manufacturers of electronic gadgets such as tablet PCs .
In 2013 , Nigeria introduced a policy regarding import duty on vehicles to encourage local manufacturing companies in the country .
The city of Aba in the south - eastern part of the country is well known for handicrafts and shoes , known as " Aba made " .
Nigeria's primary energy consumption was about 108 Mtoe in 2011 .
Most of the energy comes from traditional biomass and waste , which account for 83 % of total primary production .
The rest is from fossil fuels ( 16 % ) and hydropower ( 1 % ) .
Since independence , Nigeria has tried to develop a domestic nuclear industry for energy .
In 2007 , President Umaru Yar'Adua urged the country to embrace nuclear power to meet its growing energy needs .
In June 2015 , Nigeria selected two sites for the planned construction of the nuclear plants .
Nigeria suffers from a lack of adequate transportation infrastructure .
There are 54 airports in Nigeria ; the principal airports are Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos and Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja .
As with other transportation facilities , the airports suffer from a poor reputation for safety and operational efficiency .
However , the Nigerian government has become threatened by how its citizens are using the internet to influence governance and political changes .
The government has recently begun expanding this infrastructure to space - based communications .
Nigeria has a space satellite that is monitored at the Nigerian National Space Research and Development Agency Headquarters in Abuja .
The Nigerian government has commissioned the overseas production and launch of four satellites .
On 11 November 2008 , NigComSat - 1 failed in orbit after running out of power because of an anomaly in its solar array .
The NigeriaSat - 2 spacecraft alone was built at a cost of over £ 35 million .
This satellite was launched into orbit by a military base in China .
On 10 November 2008 ( 0900 GMT ) , the satellite was reportedly switched off for analysis and to avoid a possible collision with other satellites .
According to Nigerian Communications Satellite Limited , it was put into " emergency mode operation to effect mitigation and repairs " .
The satellite eventually failed after losing power on 11 November 2008 .
National census results in the past few decades have been disputed .
According to the United Nations , Nigeria has been undergoing explosive population growth and has one of the highest growth and fertility rates in the world .
By their projections , Nigeria is one of eight countries expected to account collectively for half of the world's total population increase in 2005 – 2050 .
In 1950 , Nigeria had only 33 million people . In 2012 , President Goodluck Jonathan said Nigerians should limit their number of children .
Millions of Nigerians have emigrated during times of economic hardship , primarily to Europe , North America and Australia .
It is estimated that over a million Nigerians have emigrated to the United States and constitute the Nigerian American populace .
Individuals in many such Diasporic communities have joined the " Egbe Omo Yoruba " society , a national association of Yoruba descendants in North America .
Nigeria has more than 250 ethnic groups , with varying languages and customs , creating a country of rich ethnic diversity .
Many ex - slaves came to Nigeria following the emancipation of slaves in the Americas .
521 languages have been spoken in Nigeria ; nine of them are extinct .
In some areas of Nigeria , ethnic groups speak more than one language .
The official language of Nigeria , English , was chosen to facilitate the cultural and linguistic unity of the country , owing to the influence of British colonisation which ended in 1960 .
The French spoken in Nigeria may be mixed with some native languages .
English as a first language is used by only a small minority of the country's urban elite , and it is not spoken at all in some rural areas .
Hausa is the most widely spoken of the three main languages spoken in Nigeria .
With the majority of Nigeria's populace in the rural areas , the major languages of communication in the country remain indigenous languages .
Some of the largest of these , notably Yoruba and Igbo , have derived standardised languages from several different dialects and are widely spoken by those ethnic groups .
Nigeria is a religiously diverse society , with Islam and Christianity being the most widely professed religions .
Nigerians are nearly equally divided into Muslims and Christians , with a tiny minority of adherents of traditional African religions and other religions .
The Christian share of Nigeria's population is on the decline because of the lower fertility rate compared to Muslims in the north .
As in other parts of Africa where Islam and Christianity are dominant , religious syncretism with the traditional African religions is common .
However , these estimates should be taken with caution because sample data is mostly collected from major urban areas in the south , which are predominantly Christian .
In the west , the Yoruba tribe is predominantly split between Muslims and Christians with 10 % adherents of traditional religions .
Protestant and locally cultivated Christianity are widely practised in Western areas , while Roman Catholicism is a more prominent Christian feature of South Eastern Nigeria .
Both Roman Catholicism and Protestantism are observed in the Ibibio , Anaang , Efik , Ijo and Ogoni lands of the south .
Nigeria has the largest Muslim population in sub - Saharan Africa .
Some northern states have incorporated Sharia law into their previously secular legal systems , which has brought about some controversy .
Kano State has sought to incorporate Sharia law into its constitution .
Health care delivery in Nigeria is a concurrent responsibility of the three tiers of government in the country , and the private sector .
The new strategy dramatically increased accessibility through community - based health care reform , resulting in more efficient and equitable provision of services .
Nigeria became the second African country to have successfully carried out this surgery .
Retaining these expensively trained professionals has been identified as one of the goals of the government .
Education in Nigeria is overseen by the Ministry of Education .
The education system is divided into kindergarten , primary education , secondary education and tertiary education .
The government has majority control of university education .
Nigeria poverty rates have gone down significantly in the 2010s because of economic growth .
Having made their plans to reduce this number , Nigeria has presented a plan to the World Bank Group to lower this number tremendously .
Government instability , which affects the rate at which citizens are employed , is the major reason for the poverty levels being higher in certain periods
Discrimination based on sex is a significant human rights issue .
Women throughout the country were only politically emancipated in 1979 .
Yet husbands continue to dictate the votes for many women in Nigeria , which upholds the patriarchal system .
Most workers in the informal sector are women .
Women's representation in government since independence from Britain is very poor .
Women have been reduced to sideline roles in appointive posts throughout all levels of government and still make up a tiny minority of elected officials .
Nigerian citizens have authored many influential works of post - colonial literature in the English language .
There are many festivals in Nigeria , some of which date to the period before the arrival of the major religions in this ethnically and culturally diverse society .
The main Muslim and Christian festivals are often celebrated in ways that are unique to Nigeria or unique to the people of a locality .
The Nigerian Tourism Development Corporation has been working with the states to upgrade the traditional festivals , which may become important sources of tourism revenue .
The Nigerian film industry is known as Nollywood ( a blend of Nigeria and Hollywood ) and is now the largest producer of movies in the world takeover from India's Bollywood .
Although Nigerian films have been produced since the 1960s , the country's film industry has been aided by the rise of affordable digital filming and editing technologies .
The film was a critical and commercial success in Nigeria , and it was also screened in international film festivals .
T.B . Joshua's Emmanuel TV , originating from Nigeria , is one of the most viewed television across Africa .
The Nigerian comedy industry keep increasing their exposure by hosting independent comedy shows and comedy competitions in Nigeria and abroad .
Nigerian cuisine , like West African cuisine in general , is known for its richness and variety .
Nigerian feasts are colourful and lavish , while aromatic market and roadside snacks cooked on barbecues or fried in oil are plentiful and varied .
Football is largely considered Nigeria's national sport , and the country has its own Premier League of football .
In the early 1990s , Scrabble was made an official sport in Nigeria .
Anatomy is a branch of natural science which deals with the structural organization of living things .
It is an old science , having its beginnings in prehistoric times .
Human anatomy is one of the essential basic sciences that are applied in medicine .
The history of anatomy is characterized by a progressive understanding of the functions of the organs and structures of the human body .
The discipline of anatomy is divided into macroscopic and microscopic .
Macroscopic anatomy , or gross anatomy , is the examination of an animal's body parts using unaided eyesight .
Gross anatomy also includes the branch of superficial anatomy .
Most animals have bodies differentiated into separate tissues and these animals are also known as eumetazoans
Vacuoles , when present , are more in number and much smaller than those in the plant cell .
The body tissues are composed of numerous types of cell , including those found in muscles , nerves and skin .
Each typically has a cell membrane formed of phospholipids , cytoplasm and a nucleus . All of the different cells of an animal are derived from the embryonic germ layers .
All of a triploblastic animal's tissues and organs are derived from the three germ layers of the embryo , the ectoderm , mesoderm and endoderm .
Connective tissue gives shape to organs and holds them in place .
The main types are loose connective tissue , adipose tissue , fibrous connective tissue , cartilage and bone .
The extracellular matrix contains proteins , the chief and most abundant of which is collagen .
Collagen plays a major part in organizing and maintaining tissues .
The matrix can be modified to form a skeleton to support or protect the body .
An endoskeleton is internal and present in all developed animals , as well as in many of those less developed .
There are many different types of epithelium , modified to suit a particular function .
In more advanced animals , many glands are formed of epithelial cells .
Muscle cells ( myocytes ) form the active contractile tissue of the body .
Muscle tissue functions to produce force and cause motion , either locomotion or movement within internal organs .
Smooth muscle has no striations when examined microscopically .
It contracts slowly but maintains contractibility over a wide range of stretch lengths .
It is found in such organs as sea anemone tentacles and the body wall of sea cucumbers .
Skeletal muscle contracts rapidly but has a limited range of extension .
It is found in the movement of appendages and jaws .
Obliquely striated muscle is intermediate between the other two .
The filaments are staggered and this is the type of muscle found in earthworms that can extend slowly or make rapid contractions .
In higher animals striated muscles occur in bundles attached to bone to provide movement and are often arranged in antagonistic sets .
Cardiac muscle is found only in the heart , allowing it to contract and pump blood round the body .
Nervous tissue is composed of many nerve cells known as neurons which transmit information .
In simple animals , receptor neurons in the body wall cause a local reaction to a stimulus .
The latter consists of sensory nerves that transmit information from sense organs and motor nerves that influence target organs .
The spinal cord is protected by the vertebral column and is above the notochord and the gastrointestinal tract is below it .
At the posterior end is a tail which continues the spinal cord and vertebrae but not the gut .
The mouth is found at the anterior end of the animal , and the anus at the base of the tail .
The limbs of vertebrates are considered to be homologous because the same underlying skeletal structure was inherited from their last common ancestor .
The main skeletal element is the vertebral column , composed of articulating vertebrae which are lightweight yet strong .
The ribs attach to the spine and there are no limbs or limb girdles .
They are supported by the muscles which compose the main part of the trunk .
The eyes are adapted for seeing underwater and have only local vision .
The bony fish lineage shows more derived anatomical traits , often with major evolutionary changes from the features of ancient fish .
Sharks and rays are basal fish with numerous primitive anatomical features similar to those of ancient fish , including skeletons composed of cartilage .
They mostly spawn a large number of small eggs with little yolk which they broadcast into the water column .
These are then closed and the air is forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat .
They supplement this with gas exchange through the skin which needs to be kept moist .
In frogs the pelvic girdle is robust and the hind legs are much longer and stronger than the forelimbs .
The feet have four or five digits and the toes are often webbed for swimming or have suction pads for climbing .
The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer .
These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine .
The skull has two openings ( fenestrae ) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull .
There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews .
The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw and eventually wear down .
The brain and heart are more primitive than those of other reptiles , and the lungs have a single chamber and lack bronchi .
Lizards have moveable eyelids , eardrums are present and some species have a central parietal eye .
Snakes are closely related to lizards , having branched off from a common ancestral lineage during the Cretaceous period , and they share many of the same features .
The skeleton consists of a skull , a hyoid bone , spine and ribs though a few species retain a vestige of the pelvis and rear limbs in the form of pelvic spurs .
The bar under the second fenestra has also been lost and the jaws have extreme flexibility allowing the snake to swallow its prey whole .
Snakes lack moveable eyelids , the eyes being covered by transparent " spectacle " scales .
They do not have eardrums but can detect ground vibrations through the bones of their skull .
Their forked tongues are used as organs of taste and smell and some species have sensory pits on their heads enabling them to locate warm - blooded prey .
Crocodilians are large , low - slung aquatic reptiles with long snouts and large numbers of teeth .
The head and trunk are dorso - ventrally flattened and the tail is laterally compressed .
It undulates from side to side to force the animal through the water when swimming .
The tough keratinized scales provide body armour and some are fused to the skull .
Valves seal the nostrils and ears when it is submerged .
Unlike other reptiles , crocodilians have hearts with four chambers allowing complete separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood .
Capitalism is an economic system based on the private ownership and control of the means of production and their operation for profit .
No country's economic system is completely or purely capitalist , as governments may not allow free markets to determine all prices .
Different forms of capitalism feature varying degrees of free markets , public ownership , obstacles to free competition and state - sanctioned social policies .
The extent to which different markets are free and the rules defining private property are matters of politics and policy .
Market economies have existed under many forms of government and in many different times , places and cultures .
Modern capitalist societies developed in Western Europe in a process that led to the Industrial Revolution .
Capitalist systems with varying degrees of direct government intervention have since become dominant in the Western world and continue to spread .
Economic growth is a characteristic tendency of capitalist economies .
These innovations migrated to Europe through trade partners in cities such as Venice and Pisa .
Instead of a serf - based system of labor , workers were increasingly employed as part of a broader and expanding money - based economy .
Terms of rent for land were becoming subject to economic market forces rather than to the previous stagnant system of custom and feudal obligation .
The economic doctrine prevailing from the 16th to the 18th centuries is commonly called mercantilism .
This period , the Age of Discovery , was associated with the geographic exploration of foreign lands by merchant traders , especially from England and the Low Countries .
Mercantilism was a system of trade for profit , although commodities were still largely produced by non - capitalist methods .
European merchants , backed by state controls , subsidies and monopolies , made most of their profits by buying and selling goods .
These companies were characterized by their colonial and expansionary powers given to them by nation - states .
Industrial Britain eventually abandoned the protectionist policy formerly prescribed by mercantilism .
Britain reduced tariffs and quotas , in line with David Ricardo's advocacy of free trade .
The imperialism of the 18th - century decisively shaped globalization in this period .
Also in this period , Europeans colonized areas of sub - Saharan Africa and the Pacific islands .
In this period , the global financial system was mainly tied to the gold standard .
The postwar boom ended in the late 1960s and early 1970s and the economic situation grew worse with the rise of stagflation .
The relationship between democracy and capitalism is a contentious area in theory and in popular political movements .
He also argued that a market economy provided a substitute for government control of the economy , which reduces the risks of tyranny and authoritarianism
He argued that the market mechanism is the only way of deciding what to produce and how to distribute the items without using coercion .
Some of Friedman's views were shared by John Maynard Keynes , who believed that capitalism was vital for freedom to survive and thrive .
According to Hahnel , there are a few objections to the premise that capitalism offers freedom through economic freedom .
These objections are guided by critical questions about who or what decides whose freedoms are more protected .
Often , the question of inequality is brought up when discussing how well capitalism promotes democracy .
An argument that could stand is that economic growth can lead to inequality given that capital can be acquired at different rates by different people .
Nonetheless , it often comes under fire for its style of government which , though democratic and consistently one of the least corrupt , operates largely under a one - party rule .
The term " capitalism " in its modern sense is often attributed to Karl Marx .
Competition arises when more than one producer is trying to sell the same or similar products to the same buyers .
Hence , the firm can engage in rent seeking behaviors such as limiting output and raising prices because it has no fear of competition .
A cartel is a group of firms that act together in a monopolistic manner to control output and prices .
Governments have implemented legislation for the purpose of preventing the creation of monopolies and cartels .
In 1890 , the Sherman Antitrust Act became the first legislation passed by the United States Congress to limit monopolies .
These transactions usually occur in a labor market where wages or salaries are market - determined .
A wage laborer is a person whose primary means of income is from the selling of their labor in this way .
Accordingly , businesses seek to benefit themselves and / or their shareholders by maximizing profit .
In capitalist theoretics , the profit motive is said to ensure that resources are being allocated efficiently .
Competition is widespread throughout the market process .
It is a condition where " buyers tend to compete with other buyers , and sellers tend to compete with other sellers " .
Similarly , sellers bid against other sellers in offering goods on the market , competing for the attention and exchange resources of buyers .
In the works of Adam Smith , the idea of capitalism is made possible through competition which creates growth .
One of the foundational blocks of capitalism is competition .
Smith believed that a prosperous society is one where " everyone should be free to enter and leave the market and change trades as often as he pleases . "
Although capitalism has not entered mainstream economics at the time of Smith , it is vital to the construction of his ideal society .
He believed that the freedom to act in one's self - interest is essential for the success of a capitalist society .
The fear arises that if all participants focus on their own goals , society's well - being will be water under the bridge .
The capitalist mode of production refers to the systems of organising production and distribution within capitalist societies .
Essentially , capital accumulation comes to define economic rationality in capitalist production .
Government agencies regulate the standards of service in many industries , such as airlines and broadcasting , as well as financing a wide range of programs .
In capitalist economic structures , supply and demand is an economic model of price determination in a market .
A supply schedule is a table that shows the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity supplied .
Just like the supply curves reflect marginal cost curves , demand curves are determined by marginal utility curves .
This price is often called the competitive price or market clearing price , and will tend not to change unless demand or supply changes .
Partial equilibrium , as the name suggests , takes into consideration only a part of the market to attain equilibrium .
There are many variants of capitalism in existence that differ according to country and region .
They vary in their institutional makeup and by their economic policies .
Advanced capitalism is the situation that pertains to a society in which the capitalist model has been integrated and developed deeply and extensively for a prolonged period .
Jürgen Habermas has been a major contributor to the analysis of advanced - capitalistic societies .
Corporate capitalism is a free or mixed - market capitalist economy characterized by the dominance of hierarchical , bureaucratic corporations .
Finance capitalism is the subordination of processes of production to the accumulation of money profits in a financial system .
It typically entails support for highly competitive markets and private ownership of the means of production .
Laissez - faire capitalism is a more extensive form of this free - market economy , but one in which the role of the state is limited to protecting property rights .
In anarcho - capitalist theory , property rights are protected by private firms and market - generated law .
Mercantilism is a nationalist form of early capitalism that came into existence approximately in the late 16th century .
It is characterized by the intertwining of national business interests with state - interest and imperialism .
Consequently , the state apparatus is utilized to advance national business interests abroad .
This model is prominent in Western and Northern European countries as well as Japan , albeit in slightly different configurations .
The vast majority of enterprises are privately owned in this economic model .
Rhine capitalism is the contemporary model of capitalism and adaptation of the social market model that exists in continental Western Europe today .
State capitalism has been defined in various ways . The term has been used to distinguish from market capitalism .
State capitalism is also used to refer to command economies in the former Eastern Bloc .
Merriam - Webster defines state capitalism as " an economic system in which private capitalism is modified by a varying degree of government ownership and control " .
The term is not used by Austrian School economists to describe state ownership of the means of production .
The debate between proponents of private versus state capitalism is centered around questions of managerial efficacy , productive efficiency and fair distribution of wealth .
Welfare capitalism is capitalism that includes social welfare policies .
Most modern capitalist economies are defined as mixed economies to some degree .
Therefore , governments should use market - based policy - instruments ( such as a carbon tax ) to resolve environmental problems .
A capitalistic economy must expand to survive and find new markets to support this expansion .
Capitalist systems are often destructive to the environment as well as certain individuals without access to proper representation .
However , sustainability provides quite the opposite ; it implies not only a continuation , but a replenishing of resources .
The importance of sustainable capitalism has been more recently recognized , but the concept is not new .
Controversy surrounds the concept as it requires an increase in sustainable practices and a marked decrease in current consumptive behaviors .
The accumulation of capital is the process of " making money " , or growing an initial sum of money through investment in production .
The term " accumulation " is occasionally used in national accounts .
Wage labor refers to the sale of labor under a formal or informal employment contract to an employer .
These transactions usually occur in a labor market where wages are market determined .
Individuals who possess and supply financial capital to productive ventures often become owners , either jointly ( as shareholders ) or individually .
In Marxist economics , these owners of the means of production and suppliers of capital are generally called capitalists .
The major characteristic of a market economy is the existence of factor markets that play a dominant role in the allocation of capital and the factors of production .
For market economies to function efficiently , governments must establish clearly defined and enforceable property rights for assets and capital goods .
These enterprises utilize a market - determined free price system to allocate capital goods and labor .
Market economies rely upon a price system to signal market actors to adjust production and investment .
Different perspectives exist on the role of government in both regulating and guiding market economies and in addressing social inequalities produced by markets .
There are different variations of capitalism with different relationships to markets .
Capitalism has been dominant in the Western world since the end of feudalism .
Higher demand for certain goods and services lead to higher prices and lower demand for certain goods lead to lower prices .
It typically entails support for highly competitive markets , private ownership of productive enterprises .
Laissez - faire is a more extensive form of free - market economy where the role of the state is limited to protecting property rights .
Laissez - faire is synonymous with what was referred to as strict capitalist free - market economy during the early and mid - 19th century as a classical liberal ideal to achieve .
Right - libertarian advocates of anarcho - capitalism see the state as morally illegitimate and economically unnecessary and destructive .
Thus , critics of laissez - faire as commonly understood argues that a truly laissez - faire system would be anti - capitalist and socialist .
Welfare capitalism is a capitalist economy that includes public policies favoring extensive provisions for social welfare services .
Anglo - Saxon capitalism is the form of capitalism predominant in Anglophone countries and typified by the economy of the United States .
It is contrasted with European models of capitalism such as the continental social market model and the Nordic model .
Anglo - Saxon capitalism refers to a macroeconomic policy regime and capital market structure common to the Anglophone economies .
The aim of the social market economy is to realize greatest prosperity combined with best possible social security .
One difference from the free market economy is that the state is not passive , but instead takes active regulatory measures .
The social policy objectives include employment , housing and education policies , as well as a socio - politically motivated balancing of the distribution of income growth .
Characteristics of social market economies are a strong competition policy and a contractionary monetary policy .
Market socialism is a form of market economy where the means of production are socially owned .
Advocates of market socialism such as Jaroslav Vaněk argue that genuinely free markets are not possible under conditions of private ownership of productive property .
A more contemporary model of market socialism is that put forth by the American economist John Roemer , referred to as economic democracy .
In this model , social ownership is achieved through public ownership of equity in a market economy .
These cooperative enterprises would compete with each other in the same way private companies compete with each other in a capitalist market .
Self - managed market socialism was promoted in Yugoslavia by economists Branko Horvat and Jaroslav Vaněk .
In the self - managed model of socialism , firms would be directly owned by their employees and the management board would be elected by employees .
These cooperative firms would compete with each other in a market for both capital goods and for selling consumer goods .
Prices are set by a largely free - price system and the state - owned enterprises are not subjected to micromanagement by a government planning agency .
A similar system called socialist - oriented market economy has emerged in Vietnam following the Đổi Mới reforms in 1986 .
The economist Jeffrey Sachs has stated that his work was inspired by the healing characteristics of Judaism .
In the Christian faith , the liberation theology movement advocated involving the church in labor market capitalism .
Many priests and nuns integrated themselves into labor organizations while others moved into the slums to live among the poor .
The Holy Trinity was interpreted as a call for social equality and the elimination of poverty .
However , the Pope was highly active in his criticism of liberation theology .
He was particularly concerned about the increased fusion between Christianity and Marxism .
He closed Catholic institutions that taught liberation theology and dismissed some of its activists from the church .
The Buddhist approach to the market economy was dealt with in E . F . Schumacher’s 1966 essay " Buddhist Economics " .
Schumacher asserted that a market economy guided by Buddhist principles would more successfully meet the needs of its people .
He emphasized the importance or pursuing occupations that adhered to Buddhist teachings .
The essay would later become required reading for a course that Clair Brown offered at University of California , Berkeley .
Stiglitz's critique applies to both existing models of capitalism and to hypothetical models of market socialism .
The development of the market economy involved coercion , exploitation and violence that Smith's moral philosophy could not countenance .
The Riddler has an obsession with riddles , puzzles and word games
The character's origin story recounts that the Riddler , whose real name is Edward Nigma , becomes fascinated with puzzles at a young age .
He breaks into the school at night to practice the puzzle until he is able to solve it in under a minute .
Due to this he wins the contest and is given a book of riddles as a prize .
Falcone eventually loses his patience with Riddler and has his daughter throw him out on the 1st of April .
This may be why Riddler was left alive , as matters are traditionally reversed on the holiday .
He appeared again in the same chapter of the story in which Harvey Dent is disfigured when Batman comes to him for information about the attack .
He later showed up as a member of Two - Face's jury during the Hangman's trial .
It is there that he manipulates her into believing that some of Batman's most dangerous foes are after her .
The Riddler appears in The Question series , being convinced to become a " big - time villain " by a prostitute he meets on a bus .
He hijacks the bus and begins asking riddles , killing and robbing anyone that gets them wrong .
Question quickly subdues him by asking him philosophical riddles in return .
He is outwitted and has a mental breakdown before being set free as a reward for getting one last riddle right .
In the one - shot " Riddler : The Riddle Factory " , the Riddler becomes the host of an underground game show that focuses on digging up dirt on celebrities .
Many of the famous people that he humiliates end up committing suicide shortly afterward , suggesting that perhaps Riddler did more than just inspire their deaths .
The walls are electrically wired , and a set of bumpers are the only thing that prevents the water from touching the walls and causing Batman to die by electrocution .
This event helps lay the foundations for Riddler's future confrontations with Green Arrow .
However , Elliott is , in fact , eager for his mother to die in order to inherit her fortune .
Elliott , who goes on to secretly become the masked criminal Hush , explains he wants to get revenge on his childhood friend Bruce Wayne .
In the story " Pushback " , Hush reappears and beats Riddler senseless across a rooftop .
Seeking refuge , Riddler goes to the Joker and the Penguin .
He offers to tell the Joker who had killed his pregnant wife Jeannie if the Clown Prince of Crime would protect him from Hush .
A chance encounter with an ex - NSA codebreaker gives him a positive environment in which to recover his mind .
During that stay , he experiences an induced flashback that leads him to realize that his father had abused him many years ago .
Once Riddler discovers this , he also realizes that his compulsion is born out of a strong desire , to tell the truth , to prove his innocence of deception .
Since then , Riddler has spent most of his time either legally amassing a huge fortune or attacking various heroes in order to prove his new - found power .
When he awakes , he is cured of his insanity and of his obsession with riddles , while retaining both his genius intellect and his mammoth ego .
He has seemingly reformed and becomes a private consultant who takes on the murder case of a wealthy socialite .
He has suffered severe memory loss from the coma , and he barely remembers his own name .
During the party , an old friend of Bruce's falls overboard and is mauled to death by sharks .
Riddler appears to solve the case with the suicide of the apparent murderer , and quickly takes the credit .
However , Batman finds evidence that suicide was a setup to divert attention away from the real killer .
As the assailant rolls around screaming , Nigma taunts him , refusing to douse the flames .
Batman extinguishes the flame and responds to Nigma's assertion that they are now allies with hostile dismissal .
He discovers that Newman is staying at the same Athenian Women's Help Shelter as Harley Quinn .
With Harley's help , he defeats Newman and returns the drug to Wayne Enterprises , earning Batman's trust for the time being .
To that end , he tracks down Selina Kyle , meeting up with Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy in the process .
When a villain named Boneblaster decides to make a name for himself by killing Catwoman , the fight ends up there .
The house is severely damaged , but Riddler is freed from Ivy's control in the process .
Seeing his house in shambles , he takes his question mark cane off the wall and begins to savagely beat the already downed Boneblaster .
During his re - enactment of one of the deaths , he is visited by both Catwoman and Poison Ivy , seeking his help in locating Harley after her abduction .
Due to the events of the first issue , and Harley's mental state , he quickly declines and brushes off Poison Ivy's threats .
While attempting to alert the media , he provokes Dick Grayson who is now acting as Batman .
Almost instantly , Riddler deduces that the Batman before him is a new one .
In the end , Dick goes off to confront the killer , while Riddler agrees to look after the intended victim .
Riddler almost leaves the woman to her life , when the lights go out unexpectedly .
Riddler immediately concludes that Dick has not captured all of the killers , and pulls the woman out of harm's way when a bomb goes off in front of her bookstore .
While Riddler and the writer hide as the smoke clears , three costumed assailants , enter the wreckage , looking for their victim to mark with their next riddle .
As Riddler stealthily disposes of the two grunts with his cane , Conundrum takes the writer hostage at gunpoint .
Riddler deduces that Conundrum and her men are all college students who specialize in police sciences .
Due to his famous rehabilitation , Conundrum's group decided to fill the void with their debut murders .
Conundrum admits that Riddler was her idol and that it would be a shame to kill him .
At this point , Riddler announces that Batman is en route to their very location , something both Conundrum and the writer have difficulty believing .
Just as the Riddler finishes his question , Dick shows up and knocks Conundrum out .
Noting her disbelief , Riddler calmly asks Conundrum with a smirk , " Why is this man smiling ? " .
After the ordeal is over , the young writer hugs Riddler , thanking him for saving her life .
Afterward , she and Riddler go out to dinner at a fancy restaurant , under Dick's covert surveillance .
Dick admits that Riddler is indeed on a path of recovery , but must still be watched .
He then calls Selina and tells her to turn on her television .
Sometime later , Riddler arrives at his office to find his secretary bound and gagged at her desk , with Harley , Ivy , and Selina waiting in his office .
As he chases Catgirl away from her robbery of the venue , the Riddler is rocked by a bomb detonation , the trauma re - awakening his psychosis .
Cackling , rambling and insane , he terminates his contract with Cobblepot and disappears .
This occurs in " Pieces " , where Gilda reveals herself to her estranged husband Harvey , who is now the disfigured criminal Two - Face .
She hires Riddler and Enigma to help Two - Face best Mario Falcone and reclaim his coin .
The plan works ; Riddler and Enigma defeat Batman and reunite the Dents .
The Riddler is rewarded with multiple dossiers of himself .
Enigma's response is cut short by her scream , implying that the Riddler has murdered his own daughter .
Redesigned in the style of the new titles , he sports a green mohawk in the shape of a question mark .
After it is revealed that Joker has secretly hijacked Arkham Asylum , Riddler is depicted as a current inmate , calmly biding his time and taunting guards .
Joker admits Riddler will have a little part in his designs but should stick around for the " show " anyway .
The Riddler later appears in both the second and third chapters of the " Zero Year " storyline .
Riddler appeared one more time in New 52 in the last three issues of Flash .
However , he is eventually defeated and imprisoned by a uniformed effort between the Flash and the Rogues .
An inmate of Arkham once again , he rather cooperatively assists Bane in unlocking a high tech door , allowing Bane access to confront Batman .
However the Joker shoots Riddler in the stomach and quickly departs , Batman appearing through the window and giving chase .
Left in a pool of his own blood , Riddler rose to his feet and limped out of the office , seemingly unfazed .
Riddler is then seen meeting with Poison Ivy , discussing the Joker's need to rid anyone who could potentially kill Batman before him .
However , Joker , who finally begins to laugh again , prevents Batman from doing so .
The present - day Riddler shows up next as a member of the Society who have placed Deathstroke on trial for appearing to have reformed .
The meeting is crashed by Comedian who shoots Riddler in the leg .
The Riddler is a criminal genius capable of extraordinary lateral thinking in decoding and formulating puzzles of all kinds .
As a private detective during the time he was reformed , he demonstrated investigative skills that rival those of the Dark Knight .
Like most of Batman's enemies ( and Batman himself ) , the Riddler has no superhuman abilities but is a highly cunning criminal strategist .
He is shown to be skilled with engineering and technology , having confronted Batman and Robin with unique and elaborate deathtraps .
However , the threat that Riddler actually poses is somewhat inconsistent across his various stories .
Since The New 52 reboot , Riddler has been consistently depicted as a serious threat , with notable successes .
The Riddler has a working relationship with the Cluemaster , although he initially resents the villain for seemingly copying his modus operandi .
The two team up on a few occasions afterward and work together on a big scheme shortly before Cluemaster's apparent death in the pages of The Suicide Squad .
In this version , he wears a solid green jacket with question marks on the very back of it and a circle of question mark tattoos around his abdomen .
His cane serves the purpose of helping to prop him up , due to a disabled leg .
In the story , he sells an unknown substance to the Joker , who identifies him as " Edward " .
Though Batman finds the Riddler's sewer - based hideout , he fails to stop him from bombing a rapid transit train .
His riddles are his method of subverting his condition so that he is still technically telling the truth , but always in as cryptic a manner as possible .
He later has the right half of his face burned by Ultraman , leading him to don a half - face and temporarily take on the name " Enigma " .
After learning of the Joker's plans to destroy the universe , he leads the League in an uprising against him .
The Joker's vast and amazing powers cause the plan to fail , and the entire League is destroyed as a result .
In this alternate future , the Riddler has become an old , bald man wearing glasses with question mark - shaped rims .
He still indulges in his habitual riddling , asking " Who is the Riddler ? " when Luthor referred to him by his real name .
He appears to have been invited to the meeting only upon the insistence of Selina Kyle , as Luthor does not appear enthused by his presence .
The Riddler in that appearance has a big question mark - shaped scar on his face and another one on his chest with his navel being the dot .
With that , Batman proceeds to drain the Riddler of his blood .
The series was canceled before the Riddler's fate could be resolved .
In his first appearance , he holds an entire Christmas party hostage , convinced that Batman and Robin are among the crowd .
This issue is also the debut of his two assistants , Query and Echo , in the DCAU continuity .
Riddler is freed by Harley Quinn alongside all the other inmates to attack the heroes .
Riddler and the other villains are then used to attack a library that Napier himself was instrumental in building in one of Gotham City’s poorer districts .
Breastfeeding , or nursing , is the process by which human breast milk is fed to a child .
Breast milk may be from the breast , or may be expressed by hand or pumped and fed to the infant .
Health organizations , including the WHO , recommend breastfeeding exclusively for six months .
This means that no other foods or drinks , other than vitamin D , are typically given .
After the introduction of foods at six months of age , recommendations include continued breastfeeding until one to two years of age or more .
Globally , about 38 % of infants are exclusively breastfed during their first six months of life .
Breastfeeding has a number of benefits to both mother and baby , which infant formula lacks .
Other benefits have been proposed to include lower risks of asthma , food allergies , and diabetes .
Breastfeeding may also improve cognitive development and decrease the risk of obesity in adulthood .
Mothers may feel pressure to breastfeed , but in the developed world children generally grow up normally when bottle fed with formula .
Benefits for the mother include less blood loss following delivery , better contraction of the uterus , and decreased postpartum depression .
Breastfeeding delays the return of menstruation , and in very specific circumstances , fertility , a phenomenon known as lactational amenorrhea .
Breastfeeding is also less expensive than infant formula .
Feedings may last as long as 30 – 45 minutes each as milk supply develops and the infant learns the Suck - Swallow - Breathe pattern .
However , as milk supply increases and the infant becomes more efficient at feeding , the duration of feeds may shorten .
Medical conditions that do not allow breastfeeding are rare .
Mothers who take certain recreational drugs should not breastfeed , however most medications are compatible with breastfeeding .
Current evidence indicates that it is unlikely that COVID - 19 can be transmitted through breast milk .
Smoking tobacco and consuming limited amounts of alcohol and / or coffee are not reasons to avoid breastfeeding .
Breast development starts in puberty with the growth of ducts , fat cells , and connective tissue .
The ultimate size of the breasts is determined by the number of fat cells .
The size of the breast is not related to a mother's breastfeeding capability or the volume of milk she will produce .
The process of milk production , termed lactogenesis , occurs in 3 stages .
Changes in pregnancy , starting around 16 weeks gestational age , prepare the breast for lactation .
The delivery of the placenta causes an abrupt drop off of placental hormones .
Milk may " come in " as late as five days after delivery .
This process is known as the milk ejection reflex , or let - down .
Although prolactin levels are higher on average among breastfeeding mothers , prolactin levels themselves do not correlate to milk volume .
At this stage , production of milk is triggered by milk drainage from the breasts .
The pattern of intended nutrient content in breast milk is relatively consistent .
Breastmilk is made from nutrients in the mother's bloodstream and bodily stores .
It has an optimal balance of fat , sugar , water , and protein that is needed for a baby's age appropriate growth and development .
The breast milk also has long - chain polyunsaturated fatty acids which help with normal retinal and neural development .
The second type of milk is transitional milk , which is produced during the transition from colostrum to mature breast milk .
As the breast milk matures over the course to several weeks , the protein content of the milk decreases on average .
The caloric content of breastmilk is reflective of the caloric requirements of the infant , increasing steadily after 12 months .
When a mother has her full milk supply and is feeding her infant , the first milk to be expressed is called the foremilk .
Foremilk is typically thinner and less rich in calories . The hindmilk that follows is rich in calories and fat .
If the mother is not herself deficient in vitamins , breast milk normally supplies her baby's needs , with the exception of Vitamin D .
Term infants typically do not need iron supplementation .
In addition to the nutritional benefits of breastmilk , breast milk also provides enzymes , antibodies , and other substances that support the infant's growth and development .
Produced during pregnancy and the first days after childbirth , colostrum is easy to digest and has laxative properties that help the infant to pass early stools .
This aids in the excretion of excess bilirubin , which helps to prevent jaundice .
IgA works to attack germs in the mucous membranes of the throat , lungs , and intestines , which are most likely to come under attack from germs .
It is recommended for mothers to initiate breastfeeding within the first hour after birth .
Uninterrupted skin - to - skin contact and breastfeeding can begin immediately after birth , and should continue for at least one hour after birth .
Newborns who are immediately placed on their mother's skin have a natural instinct to latch on to the breast and start nursing , typically within one hour of birth .
Success with breastfeeding in this " Golden Hour " increases the likelihood of successful breastfeeding at discharge .
Skin - to - skin mother - baby contact should still occur , even if the baby is born by Cesarean surgery .
According to studies cited by UNICEF , babies naturally follow a process which leads to a first breastfeed .
Shortly after birth , the infant relaxes and makes small movements of the arms , shoulders and head .
If placed on the mother's abdomen the baby gradually inches towards the breast , called the breast crawl and begins to feed .
After feeding , it is normal for a baby to remain latched to the breast while resting .
This is sometimes mistaken for lack of appetite . Absent interruptions , all babies follow this process .
Rushing , by picking up and moving the infant to the breast , or interrupting the process , such as removing the baby to weigh him / her , may complicate subsequent feeding .
Activities such as weighing , measuring , bathing , needle - sticks , and eye prophylaxis wait until after the first feeding .
Availability of a lactation specialist in the NICU can be helpful for mothers trying to establish their milk supply .
It is also beneficial to the mother , as it may improve the development of her milk supply and be beneficial for her mental health .
Newborn babies should feed 8 - 12 times every 24 hours , typically expressing hunger cues every one to three hours or the first two to four weeks .
At one day old , the stomach is about the size of a blueberry ; at day three it is size of a raspberry , and at day seven , it is the size of a ping - pong ball .
Many newborns will typically feed for 10 to 15 minutes on each breast , however feeds may last up to 45 minutes depending on infant wakefulness and efficiency .
It is important for parents to recognize the difference between Nutritive and Non - Nutritive Sucking .
Nutritive Sucking follows a slow , rhythmic pattern , with 1 - 2 sucks per swallow .
Non - nutritive sucking is a faster - paced sucking pattern with few swallows .
This swallow pattern is often observed at the beginning and / or the end of a feed .
Academy of Family Physicians , recommend breastfeeding exclusively for six months following birth , unless medically contraindicated .
Supplementation with human donor breastmilk may be indicated in some specific cases , as discussed below .
After solids are introduced at around six months of age , continued breastfeeding is recommended .
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that babies be breastfed at least until 12 months , or longer if both the mother and child wish .
Extended breastfeeding means breastfeeding after the age of 12 or 24 months , depending on the source .
In Western countries such as the United States , Canada , and Great Britain , extended breastfeeding is relatively uncommon and can provoke criticism .
Supplementation is defined as the medically indicated use of additional milk or fluid products to feed in infant , in addition to breastmilk , during the first 6 months of life .
There are few indications for needing to supplement additional food for an infant .
In terms of what to supplement with , the first choice is always the mother's own breastmilk , save any medical contraindications to its use .
The second best option for supplementation is pasteurized human donor milk .
Finally , specific formulas may be used for supplementation if maternal or donor breastmilk are not options .
One situation where this may be the case is in cases of infant metabolic diseases , such as galactosemia .
Correct positioning and technique for latching on are necessary to prevent nipple soreness and allow the baby to obtain enough milk .
Babies can successfully latch on to the breast from multiple positions .
The " football " hold places the baby's legs next to the mother's side with the baby facing the mother .
The mother may choose a reclining position on her back or side with the baby lying next to her .
No matter the position the parent - infant dyad finds most comfortable , there are a few components of every position which will help facilitate a successful latch .
The mother should be comfortable while breastfeeding , and should have her back , feet , and arms supported with pillows as necessary .
This alignment helps to facilitate proper , efficient swallowing mechanics .
Latching refers to how the baby fastens onto the breast while feeding .
The visible portions of the glands can be seen on the skin's surface as small round bumps .
The rooting reflex is the baby's natural tendency to turn towards the breast with the mouth open wide .
If the newborn seems to need help in latching on , the mother should focus on helping the by infant bringing their chin to the breast first .
In a good latch , a large amount of the areola , in addition to the nipple , is in the baby's mouth .
This position is helpful in pointing the nipple toward the roof of the infant's mouth , helping the infant recruit more milk .
The neck should be extended to facilitate swallowing , and as such , the chin will be close to the breast , and the forehead and nose should be far from the breast .
Additionally , in order to achieve a deep latch , the infant's mouth must be open wide , preferably wider than 140degrees .
While the infant is at the breast , the first indicators of a shallow latch are having the areola be largely visible outside the infant's mouth and a narrow infant mouth angle .
Additional signs result from poor positioning when the infant comes toward the breast to latch .
From an external view , this manifests as the nose and forehead being close to the breast and the chin far from the breast .
This neck flexion also obstructs the normal swallowing mechanism , preventing the infant from drinking efficiently .
When the baby suckles muscles in the breast squeeze milk towards the nipples .
Some women report that they do not experience anything while others report a tingling feeling which is sometimes described as quite strong .
The baby may be seen to respond to the beginning of the flow of milk by changing from quick sucks to deep rhythmic swallows .
Milk may also let - down unexpectedly when a mother hears her baby cry or even only thinks about the baby .
Nursing pads may be made or purchased to absorb unexpected milk flows .
Infants of mothers with inverted nipples can still achieve a good latch with perhaps a little extra effort .
For some women , the nipple may easily becomes erect when stimulated .
The World Health Organization's Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding recommends total avoidance of pacifiers for breastfeeding infants .
Ankyloglossia , also called " tongue - tie " may cause shallow latch , poor milk transfer , and other problems with breastfeeding .
A posterior tongue - tie is a band of tissue that can only be felt on exam , and tends to impact breastfeeding less severely than its anterior counterpart .
Engorgement is the swelling and stretching of the breast tissue due to accumulation of fluid in the tissue surrounding and supporting the milk - producing cells and ducts .
Engorgement most frequently occurs as milk " comes in " and during the weaning process .
At the end of pregnancy there is dilation of the blood vessels which supply the breast , allowing for leaking into the tissue or interstitial space .
These fluid shifts often result in some of this excess fluid leaking into the breast tissue .
Finally , milk " coming in " can create an uncomfortably full feeling , which combined with the aforementioned fluid accumulation in the breast tissue , can cause severe pain .
If breastfeeding is suddenly stopped a woman's breasts are likely to become engorged .

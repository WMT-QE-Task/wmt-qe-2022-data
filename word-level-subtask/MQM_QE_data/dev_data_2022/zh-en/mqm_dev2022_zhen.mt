The reporter learned that the incidence of malnutrition among children and adolescents in China has decreased and the incidence of overweight and obesity has increased significantly compared with decades ago . <EOS>
Experts point out that the most important idea in maintaining a healthy weight is to “ cure the disease , ” and to promote scientific fitness and a reasonable diet . <EOS>
According to the China Youth Health Education Core Information and Interpretation ( 2018 edition ) , recently released by the National Health and Safety Commission , the key to maintaining a healthy weight is a reasonable diet and scientific exercise . <EOS>
Overweight , obesity , and blind weight loss are not good for your health . <EOS>
The health hazards behind &quot; little fat stumps &quot; cannot be ignored . <EOS>
According to Ding Gangqiang , a nutrition and health researcher at China &apos;s Centers for Disease Prevention and Control , overweight endangers the normal growth and development of adolescents , adversely affects their psychology , behavior , cognition and intelligence , and even leads to high blood pressure , hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia in children . <EOS>
At the same time , adolescent overweight is more likely to persist into adulthood , which increases the risk of chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes in adolescents . <EOS>
According to the 2010-2012 China Population Nutrition and Health Survey , China ’ s overweight rate among children and adolescents aged 6-17 years is 9.6 % , and the obesity rate is 6.4 % , with the two adding up to 16 % , Ding said . <EOS>
At the same time , the overweight obesity rate of children and adolescents is higher in males than females and in urban areas than in rural areas , and the rate of overweight obesity has risen significantly in recent decades . <EOS>
How do teenagers cope with overweight and obesity ? <EOS>
Zhang Lijiang , deputy director of the Research Center for Scientific Fitness and Health Promotion of the State Administration of Physical Education and Sports , points out that the main causes of obesity among teenagers are excessive caloric intake and insufficient physical activity . <EOS>
For this simple obesity , attention should be paid to scientific exercise and reasonable diet control . <EOS>
Zhang Liang points out that the most important idea in maintaining a healthy weight is to “ cure the disease . ” An important part of this is to educate schools , parents , and students all over the world about the dangers of overweight and obesity , and to raise adolescents ’ awareness of how to prevent them . <EOS>
Adolescents should have regular physical examinations , monitor growth and development indicators such as height and weight , and early detection and scientific judgment of whether there are overweight and obesity problems , so as to take timely intervention measures . <EOS>
For adolescents who are already overweight and obese , Ding recommends that , in addition to actively and scientifically arranging meals and exercise , adolescents are at a special physiological stage , should avoid the use of hunger or half-hunger therapy to control and reduce weight , and should not take weight-loss drugs blindly . <EOS>
The U.S. midterm elections have now entered the countdown , according to a composite report by the Associated Press on November 5 . <EOS>
On November 4 , President Donald Trump and his Democratic opponents actively “ voted ” their core electorate . <EOS>
Both parties point out that voter turnout will be key to determining the outcome . <EOS>
Forty-eight hours before the U.S. general election , Trump was reportedly busy attending the rally for the Republican candidate , while former President Barack Obama went to Indiana to stand for Democratic Senate candidate Joe Donnelly , who was anxious about the election , and shouted a final plea to the crowd before the vote . <EOS>
On November 4 , Trump went to Meagan , Georgia , to stand for Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp , saying , “ On Tuesday you have to go to the polls , you have to vote . ” <EOS>
“ The contrast in this election is unlikely to be clearer . ” <EOS>
Voter enthusiasm rose to a rare high , with early voting in some states far above normal . <EOS>
When a president faces a first-round midterm election , the number of seats in Congress for his party is often reduced . <EOS>
Republicans could benefit from an economic assessment and Trump ’ s strict focus on border security , despite the Democratic Party ’ s continuing lead in the House of Representatives , according to new polls published by the Washington Post and ABC News on Thursday . <EOS>
Polls show that registered voters like more Democratic House candidates than Republicans , at 50 % to 43 % , but are still down 14 percentage points from August ’ s lead . <EOS>
Another poll by NBC and The Wall Street Journal also showed Democrats still seven percentage points ahead of Republicans . <EOS>
&quot; When people don &apos;t tell the truth , when words don &apos;t mean anything anymore , it &apos;s bound to have bad consequences , &quot; Obama told the crowd at Senator Donnelly &apos;s rally . <EOS>
Democracy doesn ’ t work when people just lie to themselves . ” <EOS>
“ The only way to stop these Republicans now is with you and your vote . ” <EOS>
The Democrats faced the toughest Senate race in decades , with the Republicans now holding more than half of the 51 seats . <EOS>
The Democrats needed 23 more seats to gain control of the 435-seat House of Representatives . <EOS>
Analysts at FiveThirtyEight.com predict that the Democrats are up to 85 % likely to win the House of Representatives . <EOS>

LUXEMBOURG , September 28 ( Reuters ) – The European Union adopted a non-confrontational stance on Italy on Friday after Italy defied EU demands and surprised markets with a massive budget deficit plan . <EOS>
Italy ’ s Euroskeptic government ’ s target of a budget deficit of 2.4 % of gross domestic product ( GDP ) over the next three years suggests that there has been no debt reduction in the face of demands for deficit reduction alone . <EOS>
“ We have no interest in the crisis between the Commission and Italy , ” said EU Economic Affairs Commissioner Mario Moscovici on Friday , responding cautiously as the EU ’ s proposals and sanctions could have little impact on Italy . <EOS>
EU officials and diplomats still hope that market forces will persuade Italy to adjust its budget plan before it is formally presented to the European Commission in mid-October . <EOS>
Following the government &apos;s announcement of its plan , the euro fell to its lowest level in nearly two weeks on Friday and yields on Italian bonds hit three-week highs . <EOS>
If the deficit target remains unchanged until the October deadline , the European Commission could veto Italy ’ s draft budget , something it has never done to any country . <EOS>
Italy ’ s current fiscal plan “ seems to be incompatible with the Stability and Growth Pact , ” he said at a meeting in Riga , the Latvian capital , on Friday . <EOS>
But he did not say how the EU would react . <EOS>
The Ministry of Finance , the State Administration of Taxation , the State Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Commerce have recently jointly issued a notice to further encourage overseas investors to invest in China and to use the profits allocated to overseas investors from resident enterprises in China for domestic direct investment . <EOS>
This policy has been in place since 1 January 2018 . <EOS>
Direct investments made by overseas investors for profit-sharing purposes , including equity investments such as capital increases , new investments and equity acquisitions made by overseas investors for profit-sharing purposes , shall be clearly notified , but shall not include the addition , transfer or acquisition of shares of listed companies other than strategic investments that meet the conditions . <EOS>
Foreign investors may , in accordance with the provisions , enjoy the policy of temporarily not levying advance income tax , but if they have not actually enjoyed it , they may , within three years from the date of actual payment of the relevant taxes , apply to renew their enjoyment of the policy and refund the taxes already paid . <EOS>
Moreover , if the restructuring of the invested enterprise meets the special restructuring conditions and the tax treatment is actually carried out according to the special restructuring , the overseas investor may continue to enjoy the policy treatment of temporarily not levying the advance income tax . <EOS>
In order to ensure that the profits distributed by overseas investors are actually used for direct investment , the notification stipulates that if the profits of overseas investors used for direct investment are paid in cash , the relevant funds shall be transferred directly from the account of the profit-distributing enterprise to the account of the invested enterprise or the transferee of the equity , and shall not circulate in other accounts within or outside China before the direct investment ; if the profits of overseas investors used for direct investment are paid in non-cash forms such as intangible assets and securities , the ownership of the relevant assets shall be transferred directly from the profit-distributing enterprise to the invested enterprise or the transferee of the equity , and shall not be held or temporarily held by other enterprises or individuals before the direct investment . <EOS>
The notification also requested the tax department to strengthen the follow-up management according to law . <EOS>
If an overseas investor has already enjoyed the policy of temporarily not levying advance income tax and fails to comply with the prescribed conditions after subsequent administration by the tax department , he shall be deemed to have failed to declare and pay enterprise income tax in accordance with the prescribed provisions , except that he is liable for profit distribution enterprises , he shall be investigated for delay in paying tax according to law , and the time limit for delayed payment of tax shall be calculated from the date of payment of relevant profits . <EOS>
The newly revised Regulations for the Operation of the Three Gorges-Guzhou Dam Water Conservancy Link ( hereinafter referred to as the Regulations ) will be officially implemented on October 1 , and the Three Gorges Lift will be officially coordinated with the locks two years after its initial operation . <EOS>
On the first day of implementation of the new regulations , the navigation of the Three Gorges - Gezhou Dam waters is in good order . <EOS>
The Yangtze River Three Gorges Navigation Authority issued its first inspection plan at 21 : 00 on September 30 , and conducted inspections on 160 vessels , resulting in 124 vessels passing the inspection . <EOS>
At 2 : 00 p.m. on 1 October , the air traffic control department arranged the first shutdown plan after the new regulations were implemented . <EOS>
Following the implementation of the new regulations , the safety inspection plan is issued once a day at 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. respectively , and the overpass plan is issued once a day at 2 p.m. and 8 p.m. respectively , making it easier for ships to flexibly arrange the overpass plan . <EOS>
The Scheduling Regulation adds the principle of &quot; classification control &quot; for ships to be dispatched over dams.The priority of ships to be dispatched over dams is specified according to the positioning of the functions of the gates and lifts respectively , and the priority of short-line passenger ships to be dispatched over dams is adjusted to the same level as that of demonstration ships and bona fide ships . <EOS>
It is also the second anniversary of the trial operation of the elevator , officially unified with the lock scheduling . <EOS>
For the first time , demonstration vessels and new-energy powered vessels in the river and Three Gorges reservoir areas have also been given priority . <EOS>
At the same time , the Regulations adjusted the “ traffic dispatch management waters ” from the previous 180 km of nearby dam waters to 541.8 km from Yunyang Yangtze River Bridge to Shishuo Yangtze River Bridge , and divided the “ core waters , nearby dam waters , control waters , and dispatch waters . ” <EOS>
This is beneficial for the ships to choose suitable waters for locking and reduce the accumulated pressure of the ships in the dam area . <EOS>
In accordance with the current characteristics of ships passing through dams and waiting for locks , the Regulations also put forward measures to restrict the integrity of ships that violate the regulations by canceling declarations and delaying the passage of the dams for 24 hours . <EOS>
After the Three Gorges water storage , the condition of navigation in the reservoir area has been improved and the rapid development of Yangtze River shipping has been promoted . <EOS>
According to the data , the annual cargo throughput of the Three Gorges Shipyard and Gezhouba Shipyard increased from 34.3 million tons in 2004 to 138 million tons and 140 million tons respectively in 2017 . <EOS>
The Three Gorges helicopter flew through 5767 ships for two years , carrying 16.22 million passengers and 17.28 million tons of cargo . <EOS>
Deputy Director of the Three Gorges Navigation Authority , Mr Chen Dongyuan , said that the Scheduling Regulations had a positive effect on promoting the integrity of overpass management , maintaining the navigation order of the two dams , relieving the pressure on vessels in the dam area and enhancing navigation capacity . <EOS>

With active treatment , China ’ s survival rate of premature babies aged 29 weeks and over has reached 98 % , reaching the level of developed countries . <EOS>
China &apos;s National Children &apos;s Medical Center and Fudan University Children &apos;s Hospital announced on September 30 that they have introduced Canada &apos;s advanced method in the titled &quot; Chinese NICU Hospitalized Early Childbirth Prognosis Quality Improvement Project &quot; . <EOS>
The project results show that , with active treatment , China ’ s survival rate of premature babies aged 29 weeks and over has reached 98 % , reaching the level of developed countries , but there is still much room for improvement in the survival rate of premature babies and those with no complications . <EOS>
For nearly two decades , the Chinese government has focused on the treatment of newborn babies . <EOS>
At present , the infant mortality rate in Shanghai has fallen to 3.71 per thousand , well below the national average and reaching advanced levels in developed countries . <EOS>
Through four years of unremitting efforts , the &quot; Chinese NICU Hospitalized Early Childbirth Prognosis Quality Improvement Project &quot; has greatly improved the quality of survival of early childbirth . <EOS>
Professor Cao Yun , director of the Neonatal Critical Surveillance Unit ( NICU ) of Fudan University Hospital , told reporters that while improving the survival rate of premature babies , focusing on reducing the quality of survival of premature babies , reducing the incidence of complications , improving neurodevelopmental prognosis and improving the overall outcome of the affected children is of great significance for improving the overall quality of survival and population quality of premature babies . <EOS>
Through four years of unremitting efforts , the &quot; Chinese NICU Hospitalized Early Birth Preparedness Quality Improvement Project &quot; recorded tens of thousands of premature babies aged 33 weeks and under nationwide , resulting in a reduction of one-third in the mortality rate of premature babies aged young and low birth weight in China , and a significant reduction in the incidence of serious complications of premature babies , which greatly improved the quality of life of premature babies . <EOS>
Through the establishment of a national network for quality improvement of newborns , the introduction of the concept of quality improvement , and the radiation of 25 collaborative hospitals throughout China , the project aims to establish a comprehensive , systematic and effective method for improving the quality of collaboration for the prevention of premature childbirth and the treatment of newborns . <EOS>
The Fudan University Affiliated Pediatric Hospital is joining forces with the national neonatal medicine forces to develop guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections based on the accumulated experience of the project , thus providing reference and guidance for the standardized diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections in China . <EOS>
It is understood that in the &quot; China Early Birth Prognosis Quality Improvement Project , &quot; pediatric hospitals have introduced the EPIQ method to 25 large NICUs in 19 provinces across the country , aiming to solve the problem of Early Birth Infection that plagues China &apos;s neonatal clinics . <EOS>
After more than a decade of continuous improvement , Canada &apos;s national survival rate for early childhood complications has risen by about one-third , and it is now one of the best countries in the world in terms of early childhood prognosis . <EOS>
The EPIQ method has been applied to all NICUs across Canada and has been adopted in six countries . <EOS>
Paediatric hospitals revealed that two years after EPIQ intervention , early childhood infections decreased by 35 % , while antibiotic use dropped by 20 % . <EOS>
In the future , Fudan University Affiliated Pediatric Hospital will continue to promote and implement this method throughout the country , with the aim of reducing the incidence of all complications in premature babies and improving the quality of treatment for newborn babies throughout the country . <EOS>
Nowadays , it is undeniable that there are differences and inequalities in the level of treatment in different regions of China . <EOS>
According to Professor Cao Yun , as an important construction unit of the National Children &apos;s Medical Center , paediatric hospitals will play a leading role in radiation therapy.This research covers several western provinces such as Xinjiang , Guizhou , Gansu and Shaanxi , with the aim of gradually promoting the homogenization and standardization of neonatal care throughout the country . <EOS>
It is understood that Fudan University Affiliated Pediatric Hospital is joining forces with the national neonatal medicine force , based on the accumulated experience of the project , to formulate guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infection , to provide reference and guidance for the standardized diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infection in China . <EOS>
It was revealed that in 2019 , the coordination center , located in the China Neonatal Collaboration Network of Fudan University Affiliated Pediatric Hospital , will join 63 hospitals across the country in the next phase of national quality improvement in order to promote the homogeneous development of the Chinese neonatal care level . <EOS>
Wu Zuoren , director of Shanghai Health and Welfare Commission , said that Shanghai could become the center city of Asia , not only in research , but also in the construction of the entire service system , the quality of service and the results of service should have a place in Asia , thus really reflecting China &apos;s medical level . <EOS>

It is written on the fifth day of Remembrance of the Victims of the Great Patriotic War . <EOS>
On September 30 , on the eve of the Republic ’ s 69th birthday , we celebrated the fifth anniversary of the martyrdom , and Xi Jinping and other party and state leaders came to Tiananmen Square to attend the ceremony of laying wreaths to the people ’ s heroes . <EOS>
At this moment , wherever you are , pay tribute to the brave . <EOS>
The day of remembrance is a revival and even a wake-up call . <EOS>
Opening the heavy history , each martyr &apos;s name behind , is a living life . <EOS>
They , too , have a passionate youth , have a genuine love , have a caring family . <EOS>
Yet , because they firmly believe that “ the doctrine we believe in is the truth of the universe , ” they are willing to sacrifice everything to “ save the suffering of the next generation . ” <EOS>
“ If I survive one day , I will cry out for one day for China . ” <EOS>
Through time and space , the heroes set up individual spiritual road signs , guiding the direction of the forward march . <EOS>
“ Where do you come from , where do you go ? ” “ What kind of person do you want to be ? ” <EOS>
To commemorate heroes , the most important thing is to build a “ monument of heroes ” in your heart . <EOS>
According to incomplete statistics , since the Revolutionary War , about 20 million martyrs have sacrificed their lives for national independence , people &apos;s liberation and the country &apos;s prosperity and strength . <EOS>
For various reasons , many of the priests did not even leave a name . <EOS>
Countless heroes poured out their ideals with blood , practiced their faith with their lives , remembered their great name , and inherited their spirit , which is the root and soul of the nation . <EOS>
The &quot; Hero Monument &quot; will not be allowed to be defaced or damaged . <EOS>
For some time , history nihilism , general entertainment and other dark flows . <EOS>
All kinds of distorted history , devalued heroic practices , challenged the conscience of justice , misjudged value judgment , caused public indignation and alarm of the whole society . <EOS>
Fierceness can &apos;t be defiled , heroes can &apos;t be forgotten . <EOS>
The act of touching the bottom line , can not be listened to , must dare to light the sword , with the rule of law and justice to defend the heroic dignity . <EOS>
On May 1 this year , the Law on the Protection of Heroic Martyrs came into force . <EOS>
Judging from the judicial practice , some cases have been judged with great joy , not only effectively maintaining the glorious image of heroism according to law , but also releasing the positive energy of reverence for heroes and reverence for their forefathers . <EOS>
A nation with aspirations cannot be without heroes , and a nation with ideals cannot be without pioneers . <EOS>
Commemorating the martyrs and calling for heroes has become a universal social consensus . <EOS>
At present , there are millions of memorial facilities in the country , and more than 100 million visits to the mausoleum each year . <EOS>
The heart is the strongest foundation stone . <EOS>
Let heroes be glorified , heroes be defended , heroes be studied , heroes be loved , and the spirit of heroism be integrated into the nation &apos;s bloodstream . A monument to heroes will stand tall between the heavens and the earth , deep in the hearts of the people . <EOS>
The passenger traffic has been growing steadily so far , with the total number of passengers carrying between Shanghai and Hong Kong exceeding 1.7 million . <EOS>
At the same time , Hong Kong and Macao passengers are not allowed to pass the checkpoint for more than 15 seconds . <EOS>
On October 1 , 2003 , the State Council approved the establishment of an interim port for Shanghai-Kowloon direct trains , and the Shanghai Railway Port was the first port in China to provide direct passenger services on the Hong Kong long-distance railway . <EOS>
So far , the Shanghai-Hong Kong railway has operated directly for 15 years . <EOS>
Since its opening , Shanghai-Hong Kong trains have been speeded up three times , with one-way travel time shortened from nearly 30 hours to 19 hours ; the average annual traffic of passengers arriving and departing from Shanghai and Hong Kong has increased from less than 80,000 to more than 150,000 ; and the total number of passengers arriving and departing from Shanghai and Hong Kong has exceeded 1.7 million in the past 15 years . <EOS>
For the past 15 years , the Shanghai Railway Border Checkpoint for Immigration and Exit has signed a police-police cooperation mechanism with the stations along the route of the Shanghai 9 trains , and has dispatched police officers to carry out follow-up supervision of the trains , achieving a total coverage of 1991 kilometers of service and control . <EOS>
Over the past 15 years , the Shanghai Railway Border Crossing Station has detected nearly 1,000 cases of all kinds of violations , successfully cracking down on the smuggling of foreigners with fake passports and the use of other people &apos;s passports as a substitute for departure . <EOS>
The station also established mechanisms such as work exchange with joint inspection units , conducted regular drills at the integrated anti-terrorism office at railway ports , joint defense operations , and constructed a &quot; three-tier protective belt for the city river &quot; around railway ports . <EOS>
It is understood that over the past 15 years , the Shanghai Railway Border Inspection Department has continuously innovated its services and significantly improved the speed of customs clearance . <EOS>
The station also set up a volunteer service group called Jinglan to provide caring assistance to the elderly , pregnant women and passengers carrying babies . <EOS>
Wang Yi , China &apos;s state councilor and foreign minister , said in a speech Friday to the U.S. Foreign Relations Committee that China-US relations are at a crossroads once again , and that better prospects can be created if the two sides take a positive and inclusive view of each other , expand and deepen positive cooperation , and properly manage their differences and contradictions . <EOS>
“ China-US relations are our common asset , and we need to take care of them together . ” <EOS>
He said he hoped that the two countries would have the wisdom to take practical action to safeguard the healthy and stable development of China-U.S. relations and jointly push China-U.S. relations in the right direction . <EOS>
Wang Yi also emphasized once again that China will surely go out of a development path different from that of the traditional great powers . <EOS>
This path , which has Chinese characteristics , has determined that China will not and cannot repeat the legacy of national hegemony . It has also determined that China will neither become the United States nor challenge it , let alone replace it . <EOS>
In a speech titled &apos;Opportunity or Challenge , Partner or Opponent , &apos; Mr. Wang said the deep-seated crux of the problem is that some of America &apos;s friends believe China will become a hegemonic power and even challenge and replace America &apos;s leadership in the world . <EOS>
“ This is clearly a major strategic misjudgement . ” <EOS>
But this self-conceived suspicion is spreading , he said , magnifying existing contradictions , raising new doubts , and making it harder and more difficult to resolve specific problems between China and the US . <EOS>
Wang Yi pointed out that China is on a path of peaceful development . <EOS>
The Chinese have never had a gene for expansion abroad . <EOS>
We believe that all countries can live together in harmony and exchange information with each other . <EOS>
Whether in the past , now , or in the future , China will neither copy foreign models nor demand that others copy it . <EOS>
Earlier , Wang told former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in New York that cooperation between China and the U.S. would win and confrontation would lose . <EOS>
China has always been committed to developing long-term , healthy and stable relations between China and the United States , and to achieving non-conflict , non-confrontation , mutual respect and win-win cooperation . <EOS>
China &apos;s new state administration held a press conference Tuesday to introduce and interpret the White Paper on the Facts and China &apos;s Position on the China-US Trade and Economic Friction . <EOS>

Serbia declares maximum state of readiness The President of Serbia and the President of Russia will meet tomorrow to discuss the situation in Kosovo <EOS>
Serbian President Vojislav Kostunica has ordered the country &apos;s armed forces to enter a state of maximum readiness in view of the occupation by Kosovo &apos;s special forces of the access to the Lake Gjakova hydroelectric power station , which is controlled by Belgrade in northern Kosovo . <EOS>
On 29 September , the Serbian Minister of Defence , Vojislav Kostunica , declared that the Serbian army had entered a state of full combat readiness . <EOS>
He stressed that as long as the order issued by Vukcic remained in force , Serbia would continue to monitor the current situation in Kosovo and the Serbian army would respond in any direction . <EOS>
On 29 September , Vukcic said in an interview that he had briefed U.S. , Russian , European and other parties on the current situation and would travel to Moscow on 2 October to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to seek his support on the Kosovo issue . <EOS>
When asked whether Serbia , like Syria , needed Russian military support , Vukcic responded in the negative : “ I do not want a major military conflict on our territory . ” <EOS>
Wuchic also said that the Serbian army &apos;s entry into a state of full readiness was merely a deterrent to the conflict , but also a clear warning : no violence will be tolerated in Kosovo . <EOS>
The Serbian army &apos;s increased readiness is linked to two major moves on the part of Kosovo . <EOS>
According to the Serbian side , in recent days , Albanians have been rampantly arresting generations of Serbs living in the northern part of Kosovo , and these arrested Serbs have not violated any law . <EOS>
Mr. Vucic said that since March 26 , when the head of the Serbian government &apos;s office in Kosovo and Metohija , Marko Yurić , was beaten and detained by Kosovo Albanian forces , the situation in the region has escalated , with inhumane arrests and expulsions of Serbs . <EOS>
Moreover , more than 100 persons , including the ROSU Special Forces , armed police and snipers of the self-declared Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Kosovo , have occupied positions near the reservoir lake of the Kajivoda hydroelectric power station , entered ecological and sports centres near the northern dikes of the Kosovo region and blockaded all nearby roads , which were previously controlled by the Serbian side . <EOS>
Vucić pointed out that the military adventure in Kosovo had been undertaken at the instigation of Western countries , that the actions of the Kosovo army had not been notified to the Serbian side in advance , and that they violated Chapter IX , paragraph 1 , of the Brussels Agreement , as well as United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 and the military-technical agreement between Serbia and Montenegro . <EOS>
Vukcic has already called on NATO Secretary-General Sergei Stortenberg to criticize Western hypocrisy over Kosovo . <EOS>
The current conflict is still rooted in centuries-old feuds between the Serb and Kosovo Serb communities . <EOS>
Concerning the status of Kosovo , there are different views among the Serbs and the Albanians . <EOS>
Serbia regarded Kosovo as the birthplace and cultural cradle of its people , because Serbia established its strongest state there in the 12th century , and the Albanians did not migrate in large numbers until after the Ottoman invasion and the defeat of the Serbs in the north . <EOS>
The Armenians maintain that the original Illyrians , who lived in Kosovo in the 4th and 5th centuries BC , were the ancestors of the Armenians , and therefore Kosovo has been the territory of the Armenians since ancient times . <EOS>
Subjective political divisions have resulted in fierce conflicts between different ethnic , religious and cultural groups , resulting in fierce antagonisms between Serbs and Albanians in the Kosovo region . <EOS>
In 1912 , the Kosovo Albanians first declared Albanian independence . <EOS>
After the First World War , large numbers of ethnic Albanians living in the Balkans migrated to Turkey , where the Serb population rose relatively , and the practice of &quot; just taking back their own land &quot; was perceived by the Serbs as a plunder of &quot; Greater Serbianism &quot; , which intensified the conflict between the two communities . <EOS>
Kosovo has become the Balkans ’ “ powder keg . ” <EOS>
In 1999 , armed clashes between Albanian separatists in the Kosovo Liberation Army ( KLA ) and the Serbian army and police resulted in NATO bombing of Serbia and Montenegro &apos;s Southern Alliance , sparking the Kosovo War . <EOS>
On 17 February 2008 , Kosovo unilaterally declared its independence from Serbia . <EOS>
Thereafter , despite reports that Serbia would normalize relations with Kosovo and sign a global and legally binding agreement , it was unable to do so , owing to historical national resentment and geopolitical constraints , owing to multilateral forces such as the United States , Europe , and Russia . <EOS>
And just a month ago , Vucic made it clear for the first time that he was advocating the separation of Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo , once again exposing the contradictions between the two communities . <EOS>
Nearly 1,000 state-owned scenic spots reduced ticket prices by more than half and more than 20 % <EOS>
As of September 28 , 981 scenic spots have been released for free or reduced prices ( 74 for free and 907 for reduced prices ) , including Yunnan Stone Forest , Marble Three Towers , Yulong Snow Mountain , Guilin Lijiang River in Guangxi , Wuyi Mountain in Fujian , Zhangjiajie in Hunan , Terracotta Warriors in Shaanxi , Sanqing Mountain in Jiangxi , and Kanas in Xinjiang . <EOS>
In order to implement the decision-making and deployment of the Central Economic Working Conference and the Report on the Work of the Government on June 28 , the State Development and Reform Commission issued the Guiding Opinion on Improving the Formation Mechanism of Ticket Prices for State-Owned Scenic Areas and Reducing the Prices for Key State-Owned Scenic Areas ( hereinafter referred to as the Guiding Opinion ) , which calls for the improvement of the forming mechanism of ticket prices for state-owned scenic areas in terms of a reasonable definition of ticket pricing costs , innovative pricing management methods , and strict implementation of pricing procedures , and ensures that significant results will be achieved in reducing the excessively high ticket prices for key state-owned scenic areas by the end of September . <EOS>
In accordance with the deployment requirements , all regions have actively carried out the work , and have successively reduced a number of key state-owned scenic spot ticket prices . <EOS>
As of September 28 , 981 scenic spots were freely opened or reduced in price ( 74 were freely opened and 907 were reduced ) , with 159 at the 5A level and 534 at the 4A level , for a total of 693 , or 76.6 % . <EOS>
Of the 907 scenic spots , 491 were down by more than 20 % , or 54.3 % , while 214 were down by more than 30 % , or 23.6 % . <EOS>
Yunnan , Shandong , Guangxi , Shaanxi and other provinces have a large number of discount scenic spots , of which Yunnan has more than 100 discount scenic spots , the overall reduction is more than 30 % . <EOS>
Anhui , Chongqing and other 8 provinces ( districts , cities ) of the government priced 5A-class scenic spots all realized the price reduction . <EOS>
The stone forests of Yunnan , the three marble pagodas , the Yulong Snow Mountain , the Lijiang River in Guilin , Fujian , Wuyi Mountain , Zhangjiajie in Hunan , the Terracotta Warriors in Shaanxi , the Three Qing Mountains in Jiangxi , and the Kanas in Xinjiang , all of which are of high social concern , have all been reduced prices . <EOS>
The gradual return of ticket prices to reasonable intervals in key state-owned scenic spots is conducive to accelerating the transformation of the tourism industry from a ticket economy to an industrial economy , from small-scale tourism to mass tourism , and from scenic tourism to regional tourism , and to forming a virtuous cycle of optimizing the supply structure of the tourism industry and steadily expanding the demand for tourism consumption , thereby promoting the sustainable healthy development of scenic spots and the tourism industry . <EOS>
At the same time , the State Development and Reform Commission emphasizes that all regions should strengthen the price order standards of scenic spots , guide the promotion of scenic spots&apos; services , and ensure that the price reduction does not degrade their quality . <EOS>
In addition , the State Development and Reform Commission ( NDRC ) has carried out a special inspection on the recent media reports that the price of tickets for individual scenic spots has been reduced too little and that the price of tickets for certain scenic spots has been reduced too much , and that the price of tickets for certain scenic spots has been reduced too little , and that the price of tickets for certain scenic spots has been reduced too much . <EOS>

In a conservation centre on the outskirts of Pretoria , South Africa , two young lions are playing together . It &apos;s hard to see what &apos;s wrong with them , but they &apos;re not the only ones , foreign media reported . <EOS>
The University of Pretoria declared : “ This is the first ever artificially inseminated baby lion – the world ’ s first pair . ” <EOS>
Scientists at the university are studying the reproductive system of the mother African lion . <EOS>
The two young lions , born on August 25 , are healthy and normal , &apos; said Ganswind , director of the University of Pretoria &apos;s Institute for Mammals . <EOS>
His team , after 18 months of intensive testing , finally made the breakthrough . <EOS>
“ We collect sperm from a healthy male lion , ” Ganswind said during a media interview . <EOS>
Next , the researchers wait for the lion to be artificially inseminated when its hormone levels reach the right level . <EOS>
“ Fortunately , ” said Mr. Ganswind , “ the result was a success . ” <EOS>
He said the researchers “ went through several trials , but surprisingly , they didn ’ t spend too much effort . ” <EOS>
The breakthrough , he says , can be replicated and scientists hope to use the technology to save large cats that are on the brink of extinction . <EOS>
According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) , lions have become extinct in 26 African countries , and the total number of wild lions that have survived has plummeted by 43 % over the past two decades , leaving about 20,000 . <EOS>
African lions are listed as endangered by the organization . <EOS>
“ If we don ’ t do something about these animals , ” said Ganswind , “ they will be extinct . ” <EOS>
The new technology , he says , does not require the lion to be reared , but simply injects sperm into a fertile female lion , as is done in North America and Europe for captive elephants . <EOS>

With the approval of Premier Li Keqiang , the State Council has issued the Decision on Further Reducing the Administrative Catalogue of Industrial Product Production Licenses and Simplifying the Examination and Approval Procedures . <EOS>
The Decision further reduced the list of industrial product production license management , abolished the management of 14 categories of industrial product production licenses , and confined the management of 4 categories of industrial product production licenses to the quality and technical supervision departments of the provincial people &apos;s government . <EOS>
Following this reform , the number of products subject to industrial product licensing will be reduced from last year &apos;s 38 categories to the current 24 categories . <EOS>
The Decision clearly implements simplified examination and approval procedures for products in the catalogue . <EOS>
The first is to change the product inspection organized by the issuing organ before issuing the certificate to the product inspection qualification report issued by the qualified inspection and testing organ when the enterprise applies . <EOS>
Secondly , with the exception of dangerous chemicals , the products licensed by the quality and technical supervision department ( market supervision and administration department ) of the people &apos;s government at the provincial level shall be subject to post-site examination.After an enterprise submits an application and a report on the conformity of the product inspection and makes a commitment to ensure the product quality safety , it shall be able to obtain a production license through formal examination of conformity and then be accepted for on-site examination within the prescribed time . <EOS>
In accordance with the principle of &quot; one enterprise , one certificate &quot; , when applying for a new license or applying for a renewal of a license , a license certificate shall be examined and issued at the same time . <EOS>
The Decision requires all regions and relevant departments to make steady progress in reducing the list and simplifying the examination and approval procedures . <EOS>
We will intensify the efforts to publicize the enterprise &apos;s promises and postpone on-site examination , strengthen credit supervision and constraint measures , implement the responsibility of the enterprise &apos;s quality body , and revoke production licenses for those who make false promises and do not meet the requirements . <EOS>
Products involving public health and safety , environmental protection , etc . may be converted into compulsory certification , a positive list shall be drawn up and publicized to the public , and the standards of certification shall be unified , and the number of certified inspection projects shall be reasonably reduced.The cost of compulsory certification shall , in principle , be borne by the financial institutions at all levels according to the system . <EOS>
We will take support measures to encourage enterprises to carry out voluntary certification , and promote the establishment of brands and the expansion of markets . <EOS>
We should meet the international advanced standards and promote the improvement of industrial product quality . <EOS>
Give full play to the role of third-party social organizations to ensure the safety of industrial product quality . <EOS>
For products that retain the management of industrial product production licenses , we need to improve the standard system , make use of the industry &apos;s supervisory advantages , strengthen the responsibility of &quot; who approves and who supervises &quot; , dynamically assess product quality safety risks , timely downsizing of catalogs , decentralization of approval authority or conversion to certification management . <EOS>

North Korea &apos;s foreign minister , Lee Yong-ho , told the UN on Saturday that continuing sanctions would deepen North Korea &apos;s mistrust of the United States and make it impossible for the country to unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons . <EOS>
At the United Nations General Assembly , Lee said that North Korea had adopted “ very friendly practices ” over the past year , including the cessation of missile and nuclear testing , the dismantling of nuclear test sites , and a commitment not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology . <EOS>
“ But we don ’ t see any corresponding response from the United States , ” he said . <EOS>
“ If we don ’ t have confidence in the United States , we don ’ t have confidence in our national security , and in that case we can ’ t give up weapons unilaterally . ” <EOS>
Although Lee repeated North Korea ’ s complaints about the US opposition to “ phased ” denuclearization , his remarks were significant because he did not completely reject unilateral denuclearization , as North Korea had done before . <EOS>
Lee referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Trump on June 12 , when Kim agreed to work toward the “ denuclearization ” of the Korean Peninsula , and Trump pledged to protect North Korea ’ s security . <EOS>
North Korea has sought a formal end to the Korean War of 1950 – 53 , but the United States says it must give up its nuclear weapons first . <EOS>
The US has also refused to ease demands for international sanctions against North Korea . <EOS>
“ The United States insists on ‘ denuclearization first ’ and increases sanctions pressure to achieve its objectives in a high-pressure manner , even refusing to issue a ‘ declaration of the end of the war , ’ ” Lee said . <EOS>
&quot; The idea that sanctions can make us kneel and beg for forgiveness is not to understand that our people are daydreaming . <EOS>
But the problem is that these continued sanctions are deepening our mistrust . ” <EOS>
Lee did not mention the U. S. president &apos;s plan for a second special session of the UN earlier this week . <EOS>
Instead , he emphasized Kim Jong Un ’ s three meetings with South Korean President Moon Jae-in over the past five months , and said : “ If the other side of denuclearization is South Korea , not North Korea , then the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula will not become so deadlocked . ” <EOS>
The article said that even the North Devonsk , which preceded Kazan , was admired by the U.S. military . <EOS>
The National Interest magazine quoted the US Navy as saying , “ We ’ re going to have a strong potential opponent . Just look at the North German submarine . ” <EOS>
The current Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Naval Forces in Europe , Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Naval Forces in Europe , Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Naval Forces in Europe , Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Navy , Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Navy , Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Navy , Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Navy , Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Navy , Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Navy , Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Navy , Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Navy , Commander-in-Chief <EOS>
“ The submarine is impressive , ” he said . “ If you look at the development of the Russian Navy and how it uses its resources , the main effort it makes in research and development is first and foremost to strengthen its submarine fleet . ” <EOS>
But National Interest still believes that the US has an advantage over Russia in this area . <EOS>
“ I believe that the West still has an asymmetrical advantage , ” Fogo said . <EOS>
It was previously reported that the Russian Navy would deploy the submarine Kazan in 2019 . <EOS>
Kazan , Novosibirsk , Krasnoyarsk , and Arkhangelsk were all improved versions of the White Wax Tree-M , with a displacement of 13,800 tons , a dive depth of 520 metres , a crew of 64 , and a speed of 31 knots . <EOS>
The National People &apos;s Political Consultative Conference ( NPCPCPCC ) convened an important theoretical seminar on strengthening and improving the work of the People &apos;s Political Consultative Conference ( PPCC ) . <EOS>
The National People &apos;s Political Consultative Conference ( NPCPCPC ) held an important ideological and theoretical seminar on strengthening and improving the work of the People &apos;s Political Consultative Conference ( PPCC ) from 29 to 30 June in Beijing . <EOS>
Wang Yang , chairman of the Standing Committee of the Politburo of the Communist Party of China and chairman of the CPPCC , attended the meeting and spoke . <EOS>

We must strengthen the CPPCC &apos;s own construction , catch up with the education and training of its members and cadres , play the fundamental role of the Special Committee , and consolidate the foundation for the CPPCC to carry out its duties . <EOS>
We should strengthen the guidance of local CPPCC work , give direction , demonstrate and solve difficult problems , and raise the overall level of CPPCC work . <EOS>

June 1 , 2018 , Cardiff , United States , Tesla electric vehicle company logo . <EOS>
Under a settlement agreement , Tesla Motors and its chief executive , Steve Masque , have each agreed to pay $ 20 million in fines to financial regulators , and Masque will also step down as chairman of the company , but remains CEO . <EOS>
The settlement would put an end to Tesla &apos;s two-month-long turmoil . <EOS>
Investors will be relieved by the securities-fraud settlement the SEC unveiled on Saturday . <EOS>
Investors were worried that the protracted legal battle would only further weaken the still-losing electric car company . <EOS>
The SEC on Thursday sued Musk for fraud , saying its August 7 deductions mislead investors . <EOS>
Dewey said he was considering privatizing Tesla for $ 420 a share and had secured financing . <EOS>
The SEC said the deductions were virtually unfounded and caused market turmoil to the detriment of investors . <EOS>
Investors and corporate governance experts say the deal could strengthen Tesla , which has been hit hard by Musk &apos;s recent behavior . <EOS>
Steven Heim , head of Boston Common &apos;s asset management , said the settlement should give Masque more control , without taking the &quot; destructive &quot; measures that drove him out of Tesla . <EOS>
The asset management company holds shares in Tesla &apos;s battery maker Panasonic . <EOS>
Under the proposed agreement , Tesla would have to appoint an independent chairman , two independent directors , and a board of directors to oversee the company &apos;s external communications . <EOS>
“ It is in the best interests of our markets and our investors , including Tesla shareholders , that this matter be resolved expeditiously under the agreed terms , ” SEC Chairman Bill Clayton said in a statement . <EOS>
Thursday &apos;s allegations resulted in Tesla &apos;s market value evaporating to about $ 7 billion , down from $ 47.5 billion for General Motors on Friday . <EOS>
The SEC retracted its demands in the settlement to oust Musk from the company &apos;s board of directors . <EOS>
Many investors said the penalty would be catastrophic . <EOS>
“ I think it ’ s the best possible outcome for everyone involved , ” said Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial Partners , who gave Tesla a “ neutral ” rating and called the SEC ’ s punishment “ a light one ” for Musk . <EOS>
“ He ’ s still important to Tesla as CEO . ” <EOS>
Neither Musk nor Tesla acknowledged or denied the SEC &apos;s allegations in the settlement agreement , nor did they immediately respond to the request for comment . <EOS>
The settlement agreement still needs to be approved by the court . <EOS>

On the morning of 1 October , to celebrate the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region held a grand flag-raising ceremony at Golden Bauhinia Square . <EOS>
According to Immigration Control Station statistics , the number of passengers entering Hong Kong via West Kowloon Station of the high-speed railway has surpassed 300,000 as at 30 September . <EOS>

Many Mainland travellers take the high-speed railway to and from Hong Kong during the Golden Week of National Day . <EOS>
Mrs. Song told reporters that the National Day holiday is a rare long holiday in the year . To come to Hong Kong to see the raising of the flag is her long-standing wish , to achieve this wish on the National Day , I feel particularly happy and excited . <EOS>
At present , however , Ningxia &apos;s flights to and from Hong Kong are inconvenienced so that they can be operated on the Hong Kong section of the high-speed railway . After enquiring about the train schedule , Mr. Song found that the first train could arrive at 7 : 3 a.m. and connect the city &apos;s transportation to Jinpujing Square at just the right time . <EOS>
He exclaimed to reporters : &quot; The high-speed railway is really too convenient , fast and on time ! &quot; <EOS>
The 70 short-distance trains that run daily to and from Guangzhou South , Shenzhen North and Futian and West Kowloon in one hour greatly facilitate the arrival of residents in the Guangdong , Hong Kong , Macao and the Gulf region . <EOS>
After arriving in Hong Kong , Mr. Liu , who lives in Shenzhen , is preparing to visit his Hong Kong friends at the top of Central Hill . <EOS>
Mr. Liu said , &quot; National Day is a holiday for both the Mainland and Hong Kong . We are going to challenge ourselves to see if we can complete the 50-kilometer Hong Kong Island Trail . &quot; <EOS>
He explained that without the high-speed railway , easy access and plenty of time , they would not have dared to easily try such long-distance mountaineering . <EOS>
Mrs. Yang , from Dongguan , took her 10-year-old son on a high-speed train to Hong Kong to participate in the piano competition . She proudly told reporters that her son had been studying the piano for three years and that it was very meaningful to spend the National Day in this way . <EOS>
She was worried about the impact on her son &apos;s condition . She was even more impressed by the Hong Kong leg of the trip , which took her through Shenzhen on the high-speed railway . &quot; It &apos;s like taking the subway , it &apos;s so fast , I didn &apos;t even have time to take a picture , &quot; she told reporters . <EOS>
At 6 : 44 a.m. on 23 September , the G5711 &quot; Harmony &quot; high-speed train departed from Shenzhen North Station , speeding along the way , and a few minutes later the train entered the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong section of the high-speed railway , the first officially operated high-speed train of the Hong Kong section . <EOS>

Ignore the threat of America ! <EOS>
The EU may reach agreement with Iran on crude oil purchases <EOS>
The U.S. government has said it will reopen a new round of sanctions against Iran in November , even urging other countries to reduce imports of Iranian oil . <EOS>
But America &apos;s allies don &apos;t seem to be listening . <EOS>
Tehran is close to reaching an agreement with the EU on the sale of crude oil despite US threats to impose sanctions on any country that does business with Iran , the New York Times reported . <EOS>
The central aim of the agreement was to try to establish a new payment mechanism that would replace dollar transactions with barter or local currency pricing . <EOS>
The aim of this approach is to bypass the US and prevent the US from impeding financial transfers . <EOS>
At the same time , while the EU is committed to the agreement , some French and British officials have expressed concern that if it materializes , it will be the most open confrontation between the EU and the US , which opposes US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal . <EOS>
In one hour of interviews , Zarif &apos;s words sounded more optimistic than in recent months , media reports said . <EOS>
Because the agreement is capable of “ disconnecting ” America ’ s traditional allies , it effectively breaks the US ’ s attempts to cut Iran ’ s revenues . <EOS>
“ This will ensure that we sell oil and profit , ” Zarif said , arguing that countries have a legitimate right to trade with Iran under the 2015 agreement . <EOS>
Federica Mogherini , the EU ’ s foreign-policy chief , has also said recently that “ no sovereign state or organization can accept others to decide who it can trade with . ” <EOS>
She also predicted , however , that US leaders might adopt a series of financial measures aimed at banks , businessmen and states with commercial ties to Tehran before the next round of sanctions is imposed by the U.S. government in November . <EOS>
In May , the US government unilaterally announced its withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear deal , citing flaws in the deal , saying it could not permanently ban Iran from producing nuclear fuel . <EOS>
The US then threatened to ban companies buying Iranian oil and other commodities from doing business in the US . <EOS>
This threat led to the withdrawal of some companies from Tehran and the collapse of the Iranian currency . <EOS>
Companies such as Airbus and French oil giant Daedalus have cancelled billions of dollars of investment in Iraq . <EOS>
British and French officials have said that the US government may “ take the upper hand . ” <EOS>
Indeed , according to a recent Turkish media report , US sanctions do not appear to have had a significant impact on Iran ’ s oil exports . <EOS>
No other country except South Korea has stopped buying Iranian oil , Iran &apos;s oil minister Zangelan said . <EOS>
Both Zarif and Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad believe that a series of US actions are aimed at “ seducing ” Iran from violating the agreement . <EOS>
When asked whether the US would overthrow the current Iranian government under mounting fiscal pressure , Zarif even laughed , “ It ’ s a strategy of regime change , that ’ s the real purpose of the US . ” <EOS>
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) said Friday it would no longer allow imports of pharmaceuticals produced by China &apos;s Huahai Pharmaceuticals and preparations made from the company &apos;s pharmaceuticals . <EOS>
A drug previously produced by the Huahai Pharmaceutical Company was recalled because it contained potentially carcinogenic substances . <EOS>
The European Medicines Agency said it was considering further action on other ingredients produced by the plant . <EOS>
The FDA said major manufacturing process problems were discovered during an FDA inspection of pharmaceutical plants in the Huahai pharmaceutical industry and that imports were subsequently halted . <EOS>
The FDA also says imports will be banned until Huahai discovers how the impurities are produced and improves its quality control system . <EOS>
Huahai Pharmaceutical issued a statement on the company &apos;s website on September 29 saying : &quot; The company is correcting the problems in the U.S. and European official inspection with a positive attitude and vigorous measures ; the company is very surprised and regrets the way the U.S. and European officials handled it and the results . <EOS>
The company is concerned about this in the current complex market environment . <EOS>
At present , the company is organizing teams , including professional lawyers , to communicate and file complaints with U.S. and EU officials in accordance with the relevant procedures , with a view to resuming production as soon as possible . ” <EOS>

Xinjiang is the most important cotton producing region in China , and according to the National Bureau of Statistics , the area under cotton cultivation in Xinjiang in 2017 was 35 million hectares , accounting for 61 % of the country &apos;s cotton area . <EOS>
Since the introduction of diamonds into China in 1982 , the area covered by various types of agricultural crops in Xinjiang has reached more than 50 million acres , and the annual use of diamonds is about 300,000 tons . <EOS>
Among them , the cotton cover rate reached 100 % , and the cotton field cover accounted for about 60 % of Xinjiang &apos;s land cover use . <EOS>
Measured yields of cotton without membrane can be achieved from 320 to 350 kilograms per acre . <EOS>
With the continuous increase of Xinjiang &apos;s diaphragm input , the recycling rate of the residual diaphragm is low , the amount of the residual diaphragm in the soil is gradually increasing , and the residual diaphragm causes soil structural damage and other problems , which seriously affects the sustainable development of agriculture . <EOS>
The residual film not only causes serious pollution to the soil , but also has a great influence on the quality of cotton fiber . <EOS>
At present , more than one-third of the cotton fields in Xinjiang have been mechanized . <EOS>
In 2017 , Xinjiang &apos;s cotton-mining area was about 14 million hectares . <EOS>
In the process of cotton harvesting machinery receives a large amount of debris on the surface and cotton stock , the debris mixed in the raw cotton is difficult to clear in the process of raw cotton processing , and in the subsequent textile processing can not be completely cleared , seriously affecting the quality of textile products . <EOS>
On 28 September , a nationwide sightseeing and research exchange event on membrane-free cotton was held in Shaya County , Xinjiang . <EOS>
In an effort to solve the soil contamination of cotton fields , simplify cotton planting technology , and improve the efficiency of cotton fields , Yushu Xun led his team through eight years to implement the “ China Cotton 619 ” membrane-free cotton technology cultivation to “ add wings ” to the green development of agriculture in Xinjiang . <EOS>
Yushu Xun introduced the “ China Cotton 619 , ” a new line of land cotton that is particularly early ripe , salt-base-resistant , cold-resistant , and high-yielding by innovating new breeding ideas . <EOS>
Under the conditions of membrane-free cultivation in the southern region of Xinjiang , China Cotton 619 has achieved a series of supporting measures such as machinery support for membrane-free sowing , improvement of sowing depth , shallow burial of droplet belt under membrane-free conditions , suitable screening of sowing density , and rational chemical control . <EOS>
At present , a demonstration base of membrane-free cotton has been established in Aksu , Kuller , Alar , etc . , with a yield of 4,800 kilograms per hectare . <EOS>
Membrane-free cotton cultivation has achieved abundant yields , savings , environmental protection and improved overall benefits . <EOS>
Through nearly six years of research and demonstration of membrane-free cotton cultivation technology , the production of membrane-free cotton seeds and cotton can be achieved from 320 kilograms to 350 kilograms per acre , or even higher , said Zhang Donghai , an agronomist at the Agricultural Department of the Third Division of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps . <EOS>
“ The prospects for expanding the use of membrane-free cotton cultivation are great . ” <EOS>
Zhang Donghai believes that at present , membrane-free cotton cultivation technology can completely solve the problem of soil residual membrane pollution , but there is still a certain gap between the economic benefits and the land-based membrane cultivation . <EOS>
“ Support for cotton purchasing prices will help to promote it in the future . ” <EOS>
The next step , he and his team will continue to conduct in-depth research and widespread application of the membrane-free cotton , to make the industry stronger and solve the soil pollution caused by the earth &apos;s membrane thoroughly , Mr. Yu said . <EOS>
After defeating Cuba 3 – 0 in their first match , the Chinese women &apos;s volleyball team defeated Turkey 3 – 0 on 30 September to win the 2018 FIFA World Cup group stage . <EOS>
But compared to the First World War , the Chinese women &apos;s volleyball was more difficult . <EOS>
A total of 24 teams participated in the 2018 FIVB Volleyball Women &apos;s World Championship , with China in Group B alongside Italy , Turkey , Bulgaria , Canada and Cuba . <EOS>
From the world rankings and overall strength of Group B teams , Turkey and Italy are the main opponents of China . <EOS>
At the start of the game , the Chinese team was in a better position to take the lead , maintaining their advantage throughout the game and putting pressure on their opponents on both the pitch and the net , winning the first inning with a time of 25 : 18 . <EOS>
In the second inning , the Turkish team scored a fierce goal , which led the game 6 – 2 at the start , and after the Chinese requested a pause , the team gradually adjusted its position to catch up to 7 – 0 , then repeatedly intercepted the net and scored a 7 – 0 spike ; at the end of the inning , the Turkish team caught up to 15 – 19 for a time ; the Chinese team scored a point after 24 : 20 , and the tenacious Turkish team scored two more points ; the Chinese team again requested a pause , and with Zhu Ting &apos;s running attack scored the second inning with 25 : 23 . <EOS>
In the third round the situation was very tense , the scores of both sides rose alternately , at one point to 19 goals . <EOS>
At the crucial moment , the Turkish team made a mistake and scored with a 21 : 19 lead , followed by Zhu Ting &apos;s hard-hitting and Zhang Changning &apos;s attack with a 24 : 21 score ; then the Turkish team followed up with a 23 : 24 score , and after the Chinese requested a suspension , Zhang Changning scored an attack and the Chinese team locked the game with a 25 : 23 score . <EOS>
Chinese women &apos;s volleyball coach Liang Ping admitted after the match that the whole game is not easy . <EOS>
“ We are better prepared , we have good interceptions , and the Turkish team is more technically sophisticated , so we have to reduce errors and try to win by scoring on our own initiative . ” <EOS>
Faced with a familiar teammate , Ju Ting of Turkey &apos;s Bank of Wakefield was restricted in the first inning of the game that day , and then she took the initiative to change , still playing a strong offensive . <EOS>
“ We are very familiar with each other and are normally watched by our opponents , but the Chinese team plays extremely well , both intercepting and attacking when a pass goes wrong . ” <EOS>
The Chinese women &apos;s volleyball team will then take a day off for physical and technical training ; on October 2 , they will face their third opponent , Canada , in the group stage . <EOS>
Indonesia &apos;s Sulawesi island was struck by a powerful earthquake on September 28 and severely damaged several coastal cities . The latest figures show the death toll has risen to 1,200 , according to foreign media . <EOS>
The town of Donggala , near the epicenter of the quake , was reportedly struck by two tsunamis , and authorities believe the death toll will continue to rise as the &quot; golden 72 hours &quot; of rescue pass . <EOS>
On September 30 , 2018 , rescuers carried a survivor of an earthquake rescued from the ruins of a restaurant in Palo , Central Sulawesi , Indonesia . <EOS>
Disaster relief officials said the waves from the tsunami were as high as six meters , and the extent of the earthquake and tsunami &apos;s impact exceeded previous estimates . <EOS>
When the earthquake and tsunami struck , hundreds of people were celebrating on the beaches of Palau , many of whom were killed by the waves . <EOS>
Officials said the tsunami struck the shore at a speed of 800 kilometers per hour and destroyed many buildings and infrastructure . <EOS>
Thousands of houses , hospitals , shopping malls and hotels collapsed , and tsunami-induced mudslides cut off a major highway in Palau , he said . <EOS>
A bridge across a coastal river collapsed in Sulawesi . <EOS>
On 30 September local time , Indonesian President Joko Widodo visited the earthquake-stricken city of Central Sulawesi . <EOS>
Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono visited the area on 30 September , saying he had dispatched troops to help search and rescue and urged the people to be patient . <EOS>
Mr. Zoko pointed out that rescue operations were difficult because of heavy machinery and a shortage of manpower . <EOS>
He learned that there was a shortage of food , water and fuel in the affected areas , as well as that many businesses had closed after the earthquake , and that aircraft had been dispatched to drop supplies . <EOS>
He called on the victims to be patient and stay where they are to await rescue . <EOS>
Search and rescue workers in the city of Palo said they heard cries for help from a collapsed hotel in the city , but were unable to remove the rubble without heavy machinery , leaving some in need of help . <EOS>
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami could eventually rise to thousands , according to Indonesian Vice President Joko Widodo Kalla , who said power and communications were cut off in some areas , leaving information out of reach . <EOS>
China has announced that it will reduce import tariffs for 1,585 tariff items from November 1 , 2018 . <EOS>
Since this year , China has taken a series of initiatives to reduce import tariffs . <EOS>
A comprehensive tax reduction on pharmaceuticals will be introduced on May 1 this year . All ordinary medicines , including anti-cancer medicines , as well as biological alkaloids with anti-cancer properties and Chinese traditional medicines that are actually imported , will be subject to zero import duties for a total of 28 tax purposes . <EOS>
At the same time , the value-added tax burden on the production and import of anti-cancer drugs has been reduced considerably . <EOS>
Taxes on 218 tax-deductible cars and parts were reduced on 1 July . <EOS>
After the tax reduction , the whole-vehicle tax rate in China has fallen below the average level in developing countries , which is in line with the realities of the Chinese automotive industry . <EOS>
The tax cuts will boost industry restructuring and resource allocation , accelerate excellence , help improve the quality of goods and services , and are expected to push up car prices to some extent , giving consumers more value for money . <EOS>
On 1 July , the tax was reduced on 1,449 tax-deductible goods for daily consumption . <EOS>
Reducing taxes on everyday consumer goods is closely linked to people &apos;s need for a better life . <EOS>
The tax cuts were not only large in number but also powerful , averaging 56 % . <EOS>
Reducing taxes on consumer goods for daily consumption will directly benefit the vast majority of consumers and promote the competitiveness of domestic industries . <EOS>
On November 1 , tax cuts will be imposed on 1,585 industrial goods such as machinery , electrical and electronic equipment , parts and raw materials for tax purposes . <EOS>
Properly reducing import tariffs on some of the much-needed industrial goods in China can attract more foreign investment , increase domestic effective supply , help industry upgrade , help enterprises allocate resources globally , reduce production costs , and reduce domestic environmental burdens . <EOS>
The four autonomous tariff cuts , as well as the third step , implemented on July 1 this year as a result of negotiations on expanding the scope of the IT agreement , will bring China ’ s total tariff level down from 9.8 % last year to 7.5 % , the officials in charge of the State Council ’ s Customs Tariff Regulations Committee ’ s office said . <EOS>
The overall level of adjusted tariffs is slightly higher than that of the EU , lower than that of most developing countries , and at a moderate and low level , which basically matches the status and development stage of China &apos;s developing countries . <EOS>
As one of the important indicators of the degree of openness in China &apos;s trade in goods , the total level of tariffs should be adapted to the stage of China &apos;s economic development and reflect the characteristics of the times . <EOS>
China &apos;s trade in goods is the world &apos;s largest , and it already has the economic basis for further expansion of openness.However , the quality and efficiency of trade development still differ from that of developed economies.Therefore , the total level of tariffs should be reduced appropriately . <EOS>
Tariffs are the means of protecting compliance with regulations . The level of tariffs should be adapted to the competitiveness of industry , and good competition should be encouraged , while excessive protection is detrimental to the development of industry and the improvement of quality . <EOS>
Tariff rate adjustment should take into account both production and consumption needs . <EOS>
We will focus on reducing the commodity tax rate , which contributes to the upgrading and modernization of industries , on increasing the import of products with comparatively concentrated characteristics and advantages for the people &apos;s demand , and on continuously strengthening the perception of enterprises and the public , thereby meeting the need for upgrading the industrial structure and the consumption structure . <EOS>
The tax reduction effort should take into account both the fiscal revenue and the industry &apos;s ability to withstand development . <EOS>
In selecting the specific goods for tax reduction and the range of tax reduction , we should coordinate the relationship between the two markets at home and abroad , both upstream and downstream , production and consumption , and maintain the steady and positive development momentum of China &apos;s economy . <EOS>
The head of state emphasized that this year is the 40th anniversary of reform and opening-up , and China &apos;s initiative to reduce the total level of import tariffs is a major initiative in line with China &apos;s own need to achieve economic growth and development , which is conducive to the overall utilization of both international and foreign resources , promoting the quality improvement of the domestic supply system and meeting the people &apos;s need to upgrade consumption . <EOS>
This action and initiative show that China will firmly uphold its open strategy of mutual benefit and win-win , firmly support economic globalization , firmly uphold the principle of free trade and the multilateral trade system with the WTO as its core , and continue to draw development impetus from its openness to the world , thus enabling China &apos;s development to benefit the world better . <EOS>
Admiral William Moran , the U.S. vice admiral of naval operations , said the U.S. continued to focus its navy on the Asia-Pacific region , which the Pentagon has expanded to include the Indian Ocean-Asia-Pacific , even as the U.S. Navy is revitalizing its forces to deal with increasingly worrisome Russia on both sides of the Atlantic . <EOS>
In a new defense strategy released earlier this year , the U.S. ranked China and Russia as strategic rivals , according to Jane &apos;s Defence Weekly . <EOS>
Subsequently , the U.S. Navy reinstated the Second Fleet to deal more directly with Russian activities . <EOS>
The moves reportedly raised some doubts and concerns among allies and analysts , who feared the U.S. Navy might move away from the Obama administration &apos;s &quot; Asia-Pacific rebalancing &quot; strategy . <EOS>
But Admiral Moran says the U. S. Navy &apos;s focus remains on the western Pacific . <EOS>
“ No major changes have occurred for us , ” he said on January 24 , 2018 , at a roundtable discussion entitled “ Addressing the Challenges of the High Seas , ” hosted by the National Institutes of Asian Studies in Washington , DC . <EOS>
“ The focus remains on rebalancing , shifting the center of gravity , or whatever you want to describe it , ” Moran said . <EOS>
He admitted , however , that the United States has close ties with Europe . <EOS>
“ We will continue to focus on West Coast growth and balance what we can do , ” he said . <EOS>
While Moran points out that overall policy on Russia falls within the purview of the US Secretary of Defense , he cautions : “ The Russians may face demographic and economic challenges , but history has shown that they will be very tough if we clash with them . ” <EOS>
As part of the US offensive against Russia , China , and other competitors , Admiral Moran said , the US Navy is dynamically deploying troops in a “ new mode of operations , ” which will help enable competitors to anticipate where US carrier battle groups or other assets will be deployed at any given time and location . <EOS>
“ We in the Navy and the Marine Corps support it – the concept of unpredictability in combat , of not being in the same place over and over again , almost like a hairpin – and that ’ s what we do , ” he said . <EOS>
Early deployments of the Harrier Truman fighter squadron included work visits to ports and patrols in areas usually only crossed . <EOS>
Moran said the U.S. Navy is working to ensure allies know that the warships will still be patrolling the traditional regions and that logistics and family connections will be addressed for new deployment procedures . <EOS>
Admiral Michael Nunant , the Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Australian Navy , also spoke at the event , saying the Australian army could work seamlessly with the U.S. carrier battle group . <EOS>
He said the situation would continue as the Royal Australian Navy plans to purchase nine more ships equipped with the Zeus Shield warfare system . <EOS>
From a symbol of tourism to a symbol of digital economy , what has Wu Zhen experienced these years <EOS>
As the permanent site of the World Internet Congress , Wu Zhen is concerned about how to accept the summit dividend . <EOS>
In the five years since the first World Internet Congress , Wu has witnessed changes . <EOS>
In 2014 , there were only 12 enterprises in the town related to the digital economy and the Internet , and by the third quarter of this year , there were more than 500 . <EOS>
This is an epitome of the development of the digital economy in the town of Wu . <EOS>
The convening of the Internet Congress has enabled local enterprises to accept the enlightenment of the digital economy and the wave of digitization from a distance , and there is a strong desire to upgrade and modernize enterprises.Traditional manufacturing enterprises have increased their investment and R &amp; amp ; D in the areas of machine replacement , intelligent management , and so on . <EOS>
Jiang Wei , the party &apos;s secretary , said the town will build a new economic empowerment center in the future . <EOS>
The development of digital economy is inseparable from the support of infrastructure . <EOS>
This year , Ucheng launched a 5G pilot project based on the realization of 4G communication networks and free WiFi coverage . <EOS>
At the same time , Tongxiang City , where U Town is located , as the first county-level city to build a dedicated international Internet data channel , has also become the hotbed of Internet industry development . <EOS>
Since the first World Internet Congress , Tongxiang has introduced a total of 565 digital economy projects , with a total planned investment of 377.25 billion yuan . <EOS>
“ Wuzhen used to be a symbol of tourism , later it became a symbol of theater and culture , and now , with the advent of the Internet , it is a symbol of the Internet and the digital economy . ” <EOS>
According to Mr. Sheng Yongjun , secretary of Tungxiang Communist Party , the profits of the World Internet Congress accumulate over time , so it is even more necessary to build a platform to undertake the integration of talents , projects , technologies and other elements of all parties . <EOS>
Shen Yi , a Tongxiang resident who worked abroad for 20 years , returned home to start a business because of her connection with the Internet convention . <EOS>
On December 2 last year , he entered the 4th Internet Expo with a high-capacity tamper-proof digital technology solution , which was favored by a number of customers . <EOS>
Not only did Ms. Shen choose to start a business in Ucheng because of her love of her hometown , “ In Ucheng , it ’ s easier to hire people than I imagined , and our applications are fast-tracking , as is our application in the Ucheng Smart Car Parking Project . ” <EOS>
A black-town avenue , presented the Internet congress spillover effect . <EOS>
This road , which runs through the north and south of Tungxiang Township , is not only a series of tourist attractions , but also an industrial avenue . <EOS>
Based on it , Wu Zhen Avenue Co . creates a gathering area should be born . <EOS>
Journalists learned that in the future , U Zhen Avenue will become the main battleground of Tungxiang &apos;s industrial development , taking the lead in applying a large number of achievements such as smart medical care , smart retirement , smart government , and gathering industry that accounts for 80 % of the city &apos;s GDP and many high-level talents . <EOS>
In order to further encourage foreign investors to invest in China , the Ministry of Finance and other four ministries and commissions jointly notified that from January 1 , 2018 , profits allocated to foreign investors from enterprises resident in China will be used for domestic direct investment . <EOS>

Chief Executive of the Australian Federation for Science and Industry Research : Australia-China science and technology cooperation has yielded remarkable results <EOS>
“ China ’ s science and technology have developed rapidly over the past few decades , and Australia and China can achieve remarkable results by working together in the field of science . ” <EOS>
Australia-China cooperation in science and technology is booming , from tackling climate change to working on the Eye of the Sky project , Australian Federal Science and Industry Research Organisation chief executive Larry Marshall told reporters in Beijing . <EOS>
As Australia &apos;s largest national research institute , CSIRO has achieved a number of world-class innovations in oceans , energy , biology , materials , and astronomy . <EOS>
CSIRO has maintained close cooperation with scientific institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences . <EOS>
“ It ’ s a long-lasting friendship that includes a tradition of trust and long-term cooperation with our partners , ” Marshall said . <EOS>
In May , China ’ s 500-meter spherical telescope , China Sky Eye , installed the world ’ s first 19-beam L-band receiver . <EOS>
This is the most advanced 19 beam feeder receiver in the world , developed jointly by Chinese and Australian scientists . <EOS>
Marshall said the successful development of the receiver was based on the accumulation of years of CSIRO technology . <EOS>
“ This is one of the strengths that CSIRO has contributed to Fast . ” <EOS>
In addition to the above-mentioned cooperation , CSIRO also has close cooperation with Chinese scientific research institutions in the construction of square kilometer array radio telescopes , research and development of new fuel technologies , energy conservation and emission reduction . <EOS>
“ In the past , scientific research has tended to focus on the problems of the next hundred years , and now more research is needed to solve the problems that lie ahead . ” <EOS>
Marshall believes that Australia and China are complementary in the field of scientific development , while both countries face a series of challenges in their development . <EOS>
Extreme weather , for example , occurs frequently around the world , droughts and floods lead to reduced food production , and food shortages severely affect human development . <EOS>
At the same time , the problems of population explosion , aging and chronic diseases are also serious challenges . <EOS>
“ The cooperation between Australia and China in recent years has focused mainly on solving these immediate problems . ” <EOS>
CSIRO and the National Laboratory of Marine Science and Technology in Qingdao , an international center for marine research in the Southern Hemisphere , will focus on observing the El Nino and La Nina phenomena , studying the relationship between them and extreme weather , and establishing early warning facilities for extreme weather . <EOS>
“ In today ’ s environment , technological innovation is difficult to accomplish on its own , costs are extremely high , and there are many problems to be solved , so cooperation is particularly important today . ” <EOS>
The closer the cooperation , the more likely it is to make breakthrough progress , Mr. Marshall said , adding that it is also important for Australia and China to strengthen their cooperation within the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative . <EOS>
“ Strengthening bilateral cooperation , for us mainly in the field of science and technology . ” <EOS>
For example , CSIRO has recently developed a cyanide-free gold purification method . Because the traditional cyanide-free gold purification method is very harmful to the environment , many countries are hoping to find a method that does not pollute the environment . <EOS>
“ We are very willing to bring this technology to China , which is one of the results of our participation in the Belt and Road Initiative . ” <EOS>

China &apos;s overall PMI rose in September Manufacturing &apos;s PMI fell . <EOS>
China ’ s composite PMI output index stood at 54.1 % in September , 0.3 and 0.1 percentage points higher than last month ’ s and annual averages , according to data released by the State Statistics Bureau on September 30 . <EOS>
That month , the manufacturing-production and non-manufacturing-business-activity indices , which make up the composite PMI output index , fell by one percentage point , to 53.0 % and 54.9 % , respectively . <EOS>
Among them , China ’ s manufacturing PMI stood at 58.8 % , down 0.5 percentage points from the previous year . <EOS>
Zhao Qinghe said this month &apos;s manufacturing PMI has five main characteristics : <EOS>
First , the basic aspects of manufacturing are generally stable . <EOS>
Of the 21 industries surveyed , PMIs in 14 industries were in the expansion zone , with manufacturing PMIs in pharmaceuticals , specialty equipment , electrical and mechanical equipment and other industries operating at a higher level of more than 53.5 % and growing faster . <EOS>
The second is a slight fluctuation in supply and demand . <EOS>
Production and new orders were 53.0 % and 52.0 % , down 0.3 and 0.2 percentage points from last month , respectively , and supply and demand remained healthy , but expansion slowed slightly . <EOS>
The new export orders and imports indexes , 48.0 % and 48.5 % , were down 1.4 and 0.6 percentage points , respectively , from last month , bringing the economy to a year-end low . <EOS>
Fourth , the cost of purchasing raw materials for enterprises has increased . <EOS>
The acquisition price index for major raw materials was 59.8 % , up 1.1 percentage points from last month , and the factory-output price index was 54.3 % , a year-on-year high . <EOS>
The fifth is the stable operation of large enterprises and the continued improvement in the operating conditions of small enterprises . <EOS>
Large firms ’ PMI stood at 52.1 % , level with last month ’ s , and has consistently been in the 52.0 % and above expansion range since this year , with both the production index and the new orders index rising this month as the main drivers of manufacturing ’ s continued expansion ; medium-sized firms ’ PMI stood at 48.7 % , down 1.7 percentage points from last month , in the contractionary range ; and small firms ’ PMI stood at 50.4 % , up 0.4 percentage points from last month , for two consecutive months . <EOS>
That month , China ’ s non-manufacturing business activity index stood at 54.9 % , up 0.7 percentage points from last month , and recovered for two consecutive months . <EOS>
Zhao Qinghe believes that non-manufacturing as a whole continues to maintain a steady upward trend . <EOS>
The business activity index of road transportation , securities , real estate and other industries remains below the critical point and the total business volume has decreased . <EOS>
BEIJING , Oct. 1 ( Jin Li ) -- The sky is blue , the sky is clear , and the sky is full of sunshine -- Beijing has continued to open the most beautiful blue sky model , attracting thousands of people to Beijing on social media platforms to show off their happiness on a continuous screen , saying that &quot; Blue sky under white clouds , &apos;Drunk&apos; skyline , this is Beijing &apos;s best business card . &quot; <EOS>
Since August , Beijing has been blessed with the “ bluest sky . ” <EOS>
Within Beijing , people can be seen anywhere , anytime , taking photos with smartphones or holding a single-lens reflex camera . <EOS>
The Forbidden City , Tiananmen Gate , Bird &apos;s Nest , Alley , etc . can be seen everywhere on social media platforms such as Weibo and WeChat . <EOS>
Some netizens said that such a “ spectacular movie ” is Beijing ’ s best city propaganda film ; others commented that if such a blue sky long-term screen , people with cervical vertebrae disease can be cured ; and netizens hoped that “ this smear of blue can overwinter to spring and summer , so that the sky in Beijing is blue all four seasons . ” <EOS>
Why do people in Beijing particularly like to sunbathe in the blue sky ? <EOS>
It was only because people who lived in the city in the past suffered from the haze that they were so eager to see the blue sky that Beijing launched the “ Battle to Defend the Blue Sky . ” After continuous improvements in air quality , the haze was reduced and the blue sky increased . <EOS>
On the day of National Day , the weather in Beijing is fine . <EOS>
At 8 a.m. , most of the city &apos;s 35 air-quality monitoring stations displayed &quot; first-class &quot; green . <EOS>
The &quot; Bluest Sky &quot; photo contest , held by the public on social media platforms , is still ongoing . <EOS>
Why is the sky so blue in Beijing recently ? <EOS>
In August , the average concentration of fine particulate matter ( PM2.5 ) in Beijing was 35 micrograms per cubic meter , the highest in nearly five years , according to the head of the Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau . <EOS>
Real-time PM2.5 concentrations in September were even higher . <EOS>
Most importantly , Beijing has consistently carried out air pollution control , vigorously promoted the Clean Air Action Plan for the past five years , and released environmental benefits continuously , reducing the total emissions of pollutants in the region , all of which laid the foundation for the continuous improvement of air quality . <EOS>
Beijing officially launched and implemented the Beijing Clean Air Action Plan 2013-2017 in 2013 . <EOS>
According to the plan , the government continued to guide the evacuation of non-capital functions , promote energy cleaner alternatives and pollution reduction , eliminating a total of 4,923 coal-fired boilers . <EOS>
Beijing thus became the first large city in the mainland of China to achieve full-network gasification . <EOS>
Between 2013 and 2017 , the average annual PM2.5 concentration in Beijing decreased by 35.6 % ; the number of air quality-compliant days increased by 50 days ; the number of first-class days increased by 25 days ; and the number of days of heavy pollution decreased by 35 days , resulting in a significant reduction in the incidence of heavy pollution . <EOS>
At the same time as continuing improvements in air quality , Beijing ’ s officials , based on a new round of analysis of PM2.5 sources , issued a three-year action plan in September this year , entitled “ Beijing ’ s Action Plan to Win the Battle to Preserve the Blue Sky . ” Aiming at the current stage of management and pollution characteristics , the plan focuses on key areas of prevention and control , such as the management of diesel trucks , dust , and volatile organic compounds , optimizes the adjustment of transportation structures , industrial structures , energy structures , and land-use structures , strengthens regional joint defense and joint control , strives to strengthen the city ’ s fine-tuning management , and comprehensively promotes green development . <EOS>

Under the current wave of mass entrepreneurship and mass innovation , more and more technology companies are paying attention to patent research and development and related protection work , digging deep into the potential value of patents and occupying market dominance . <EOS>
Similarly , there are a lot of technology enterprises in the patent technology licensing , the use of patent technology encountered no small infringement wind wave . <EOS>
At the end of 2017 , Tan Wei , He Zhanghong , and Lai Bin from Guangdong Province sued the developer of the app , Beijing Xiaoqiang Technology Co . , Ltd . ( Xiaoqiang Technology Co . , Ltd . ) , the operator of the app , and the seller , Guangdong Pacific Internet Information Service Co . , Ltd . ( Guangdong Pacific Internet Information Service Co . , Ltd . ) , in the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court for patent infringement . <EOS>
The plaintiff requested the court to order the defendant to cease immediately manufacturing , selling , promising to sell and using the plaintiff &apos;s patent . <EOS>
On October 30 , 2018 , China ’ s Judicial Instruments Network published a “ first-instance civil ruling in a patent infringement dispute between Tam Wei , He Zhanghong , and others and Beijing Xiaoqiang Technology Co . , Ltd . , ” revealing details of some of the cases in which the app was sued for patent infringement . <EOS>
The plaintiffs claim that the patent holders and inventors of the &quot; mobile terminal-based carpooling service system and method &quot; patent , while the entire operational process of the application of the Shunfeng car in the &quot; Dip-Dip Travel &quot; APP corresponds to the technical scheme of the patent protection in question , constitutes a patent infringement . <EOS>
However , at the time of the court &apos;s ruling , Xiaoqiang Technology argued that Guangdong Pacific was not a suitably qualified defendant , and that it merely provided a free download of the relevant app &quot; Dripping Trip &quot; on the Internet , did not implement the relevant patent method , there was no direct or indirect infringement , and should not be classified as a defendant in this case . <EOS>
Secondly , the infringement in this case is not in Guangdong . <EOS>
According to the law , the place where the infringement of the patent in question should take place is the place where the method of the patent in question should be fully implemented . Therefore , he objected to the court &apos;s jurisdiction and requested that the case be transferred to the Beijing Intellectual Property Court , the court where the defendant is domiciled . <EOS>
According to the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court , defendant Guangdong Pacific provided the allegedly infringing D-Bus APP products on its network platform , and the plaintiff does not consider defendant Guangdong Pacific to be the defendant . <EOS>
And defendant Guangdong Pacific residence in Guangzhou , belongs to the jurisdiction of the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court . <EOS>
The defendant Xiaoqiang Technology Co . , Ltd . claimed that the case should be referred to the Beijing Intellectual Property Court for trial . On the basis of inadequacy , the defendant Xiaoqiang Technology Co . , Ltd . rejected the objection to the jurisdiction of the case , and assumed the costs of handling the case of the objection to jurisdiction . <EOS>
At present , the case &apos;s other hearings have not been announced , journalists will also closely watch the follow-up details of the patent infringement case . <EOS>
North Korean media criticize U.S. for not easing sanctions <EOS>
North Korea &apos;s Labour News issued a commentary on September 30 , criticizing the U.S. for not easing sanctions on the DPRK while seeking dialogue with the country , calling it &quot; self-contradictory &quot; . <EOS>
According to the article , US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said on April 14 that “ the key to achieving the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is the implementation of sanctions against the DPRK , ” stressing that the US position remains unchanged on continuing to implement United Nations sanctions resolutions . <EOS>
In the Singapore-U.S. Joint Statement , the two sides pledged to establish a new DPRK-U.S. relationship in line with the aspirations of the people of the two countries for peace and prosperity . <EOS>
There is no doubt that it is contradictory for the US to increase the pressure on sanctions while calling for dialogue . <EOS>
If we are to establish a new DPRK-US relationship , build a permanently consolidated peace system on the Korean peninsula , and achieve complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula , we should put confidence-building first . <EOS>
The article also says the US should understand that sanctions will not work against North Korea . <EOS>
November 5 - Toshihiko Kuroda , president of the Bank of Japan , said on Monday that the central bank was aware that long-term ultra-loose monetary policy could squeeze financial institutions&apos; profit margins and could undermine the stability of the country &apos;s banking system . <EOS>
But he said , given low inflation and uncertainty in overseas economies , the central bank needs to maintain its large-scale stimulus plan while keeping a close eye on the pros and cons of its policies . <EOS>
“ The Bank of Japan fully recognizes that the strength of financial institutions will be increasingly affected by continued monetary easing , ” Toshihiko Kuroda said in a speech to business leaders in Nagoya . <EOS>
If financial institutions take risks more aggressively to offset the contraction in profitability caused by years of low interest rates , he said , the banking system could be in turmoil in the event of a serious adverse shock . <EOS>
“ While these risks are not large at present , the central bank will closely monitor developments and encourage financial institutions to take the necessary measures , ” he said . <EOS>
Earlier Monday &apos;s minutes of the Bank of Japan meeting showed that at its September meeting the Policy Board discussed the rising costs of long-term easing . <EOS>
According to the minutes of the meeting , one member said that , if the economy continued to expand , “ the Bank of Japan would have more policy flexibility in the future . ” <EOS>
Another member said the committee should discuss how long the BOJ could sustain the stimulus , given its limited duration , according to the minutes of the meeting . <EOS>
Mr. Kuroda said the central bank would assess the financial risks of the easing policy , while also considering the uncertainty surrounding Japan &apos;s economic outlook , which could affect global demand due to trade frictions between China and the U.S. and rising protectionism . <EOS>
“ The impact of such problems on Japan ’ s economy is temporarily limited , ” says Toshihiko Kuroda . <EOS>
“ However , if the problem persists , the impact on Japan ’ s economy could be greater , ” he added . <EOS>
“ It is necessary to pursue strong monetary easing policies on a sustained basis , taking into account both positive and negative effects in a balanced manner , ” says Toshihiko Kuroda . <EOS>
Inflation has forced the Bank of Japan to maintain the aggressive stimulus plan , despite its growing drawbacks , such as long-term low interest rates eroding the profits of financial institutions . <EOS>
The Bank of Japan maintained monetary policy last month ; Toshihiko Kuroda ruled out a near-term interest-rate hike in the face of the risks posed by the end of the global trade war . <EOS>
South Korea &apos;s exports fell the most in more than two years in September , but analysts blamed the decline on fewer working days and said global demand for South Korean goods remained strong despite rising Sino-US trade tensions . <EOS>
Indeed , South Korea ’ s exports increased every day last month . <EOS>
In addition , preliminary figures released earlier showed double-digit growth in exports in the first weeks of September before the long holidays . <EOS>
South Korea ’ s exports fell in September , the largest year-on-year decline since July 2016 , more than the 5.7 % decline predicted by 11 Reuters analysts . <EOS>
Exports in September were $ 50.6 billion , down from $ 51.2 billion in August , according to preliminary figures released Monday . <EOS>
Despite growing concerns that the US-China trade dispute could hurt other export-dependent Chinese neighbors , South Korea expanded its exports to China by 7.8 % in September , for the 23rd consecutive month . <EOS>
South Korea ’ s exports to the US fell 11.8 % , owing to lower sales of petroleum products . <EOS>
South Korea ’ s overseas sales of memory chips and petroleum products grew 28.3 % and 13.5 % , respectively , despite market concerns that the so-called “ super cycle ” of chips may have peaked . <EOS>
“ However , the impact of the trade conflict will be difficult to avoid , because South Korea ’ s exports are heavily dependent on US and Chinese markets . ” <EOS>
Imports fell 2.1 per cent to $ 40.8 billion , less than the 3.1 % growth forecast by Reuters . <EOS>
The trade surplus initially stood at $ 9.7bn in September , up from $ 6.9bn in August . <EOS>
Thanks to the U.S. and EU countries , global manufacturing will continue to flourish , which is a positive factor for South Korea &apos;s exports , the industry ministry said . <EOS>
The statement noted that “ an increase in export prices as a result of higher oil prices will also benefit exports in the second half of this year . ” <EOS>
“ However , the continuation of the US-China trade conflict , coupled with increased market volatility following the US interest-rate hike , are negative pressures on exports . ” <EOS>
On average , exports per working day rose to $ 2.6 billion in September from $ 2.1 billion in August . <EOS>
South Korea &apos;s Mid-Autumn Festival falls on September 24-26 , so September has only 19.5 working days , down four days from a year earlier . <EOS>
South Korea ’ s exports grew 4.7 % in January-September from a year earlier . <EOS>
Manufacturing activity in South Korea picked up in September , according to the Nikkei / Markit Purchasing Managers Index , but was bolstered by domestic orders , which threatened to cloud other export prospects as orders from China and Japan fell . <EOS>
“ For the first time , we have adjusted the format of the MAKS International Aerospace Salon . We have proposed China as the host country , and our Chinese counterparts have agreed and accepted our invitation , ” said Mr. Manturov . <EOS>

During the Golden Week of National Day this year , the City Tourism Commission , industry and commerce , city administration , public security and other relevant departments will strengthen the enforcement inspection of the &quot; one-day tour &quot; market , focusing on the tourism &quot; six black &quot; disturbances . <EOS>
Yesterday morning , the city government convened a special meeting to crack down on illegal one-day trips and deployed special operations to further crack down on illegal one-day trips . <EOS>
At the meeting , it was revealed that the city has launched a special action to crack down on illegal &quot; one-day tours &quot; since July 28 , focusing on the &quot; six black &quot; disturbances of black ticket machines , black guides , black societies , black cars , black shops , and black networks intertwined with each other . <EOS>
So far , the city has received 39 one-day trip complaints , down 63 % year-on-year ; since this year , the city has received 270 one-day trip complaints , down 62 % year-on-year . <EOS>
Over the past two months , the city has seized 248 &quot; black cars , &quot; investigated 158 cases of traffic violations , closed 29 &quot; black shops &quot; and performing arts venues , investigated 13 &quot; black societies , &quot; 27 &quot; black guides , &quot; confiscated 26,000 illegal advertisements , demolished 31 illegal &quot; one-day trip &quot; billboards , three false bus stop signs , investigated 1,889 cases of all kinds of illegal travel-related violations , filed 181 cases with various functional departments , imposed a heavy fine of $ 4.4 million , and detained 111 illegal travel-related persons . <EOS>
After remediation , the illegal “ one-day-trip ” disturbances were basically contained , and the “ one-day-trip ” market order appeared to be in a steady upward trend . <EOS>
According to the introduction , in recent years , the city has steadily increased its efforts to crack down on illegal &quot; one-day trips &quot; . <EOS>
In 2016 and 2017 , the City Tourism Commission received 1,612 and 897 one-day trip complaints , respectively , a decrease of 79 % and 44 % year-on-year , but illegal one-day trips continue to be repeatedly and frequently rebounded , forming a &quot; six-black &quot; mess in which profit chains such as black ticket machines , black guides , black societies , black cars , black shops , and black nets intertwine . <EOS>
Specifically , illegal street pick-ups are known as “ black tickets , ” illegal websites that publish false travel information are known as “ black nets , ” travel agencies that engage in illegal one-day trips or agencies or individuals that do not have the qualifications to operate a travel agency are known as “ black companies , ” tour guides who do not have a tour guide ’ s license or violate their licenses are known as “ black guides , ” vehicles that do not have the qualifications to transport tourists or vehicles that have the qualifications to transport tourists for illegal one-day trips are known as “ black cars , ” and ultimately they take tourists to designated tourist shops known as “ black shops . ” <EOS>
In this special operation , the city has steadily increased the fixed inspection of illegal &quot; one-day trips &quot; and motorized patrols , aimed at illegal &quot; one-day trips &quot; high frequency and the location of tourist routes with large impact , the relevant departments dispatched a team of undercover visits on a daily basis to ride with the undercover visits , found evidence of illegal violations , and punished according to law . <EOS>
Among them , “ black cars ” and “ black shops ” became the two main focuses of the special operations . <EOS>
Without black cars , it was said , illegal &quot; one-day trips &quot; would not work , and black cars were both easily detected , remembered , and traced , as well as high-value fixed assets . <EOS>
Using road traffic monitoring probes , the relevant departments have stepped up supervision of tourist buses on the key “ one-day trip ” routes , and the “ black buses ” can be detected and tracked in a timely manner using technological and intelligent means such as technical and physical protection . <EOS>
The tourist shopping &quot; black shop &quot; because of the small number and seated operation , also becomes a strict focus . <EOS>
In order to strengthen the deterrence and punishment of illegal &quot; one-day trips , &quot; whenever violations of the law are detected in the special operations , all the functional departments shall be given heavy and heavy penalties according to law . <EOS>
In August this year , the city also held a seminar on the legal issues of cracking down on illegal &quot; one-day trips &quot; and discussed measures to combine administrative punishment with imprisonment and conviction . <EOS>
The city ’ s tourism commission said it would encourage more regular travel agencies to carry out “ one-day trips ” to Beijing , and increase the supply of regular “ one-day trips ” to further crowd out illegal “ one-day trips . ” <EOS>

WASHINGTON , DC / Mexico ( September 28 ) – After days of controversy , the administration of US President Donald Trump and Canada are making real efforts to resolve trade policy differences , prompting speculation that the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) is likely to remain in the form of a tripartite agreement , Mexico said on Friday . <EOS>
Despite the lack of details , the apparent progress was enough to prompt the Mexican and U.S. governments to abruptly halt their plans to publish the text of the bilateral trade agreement , giving Canada more time to join the agreement . <EOS>
Mexico &apos;s incoming president , Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador , told reporters in Mexico that the U.S. has made new counter-proposals to the Canadian government and that he will continue to push for all three countries to join NAFTA . <EOS>
Mexico &apos;s economy minister , Ildefonso Guajardo , said the deadline for submitting the text of the trade agreement to Mexican and U.S. legislation had been postponed because the Canadian and U.S. governments had tried &quot; very seriously &quot; to reach an agreement . <EOS>
“ In the next 48 hours , we will know whether we have reached a text of a tripartite agreement or whether we will have to publish a text of a bipartite agreement , ” Guajardo said . <EOS>
Guajardo said his U.S. and Canadian counterparts &quot; specially requested &quot; that the text be delayed . <EOS>
A spokesman for the Office of the United States Trade Representative ( USTR ) did not comment on the text of the U.S.-Mexico trade agreement and the consultations between the U.S. and Canada . <EOS>
Officials in the Office of the Prime Minister of Canada and the Office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Canada have not responded to requests for comment on the counter-proposal . <EOS>

If Trump imposes so-called “ Chapter 232 ” tariffs on cars for national security reasons , Mexico and Canada would each have a quota of 2.60 million tax-exempt passenger cars exported to the US each year . <EOS>

If Trump imposes tariffs on cars , Mexico will receive $ 108 billion annually in vehicle-parts-exempt tariff quotas , while Canada will receive $ 32.4 billion . <EOS>
Both quotas are well above the current levels of production in both countries , providing scope for growth in both countries&apos; exports . <EOS>
